Can a divided EU have any meaningful policy on Gaza?

-----

The Israel-Hamas war has exposed deep division within the European Union on policy towards Israel and Palestine.
The only unity found has been in condemning Hamas and its attacks on October 7 that killed around 1,200 Israelis.
But there’s been no such unity against Israel’s killing of thousands of Palestinians, most of whom were women and children.
At one end, Germany fully supports Israel – at the other, Belgium wants sanctions.
So, can EU policy on Gaza even be defined, when it’s so divided?
Is it effectively pro-Israel? And is this war changing positions?
