US Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib has called on the American government to investigate the killing of Abu Akleh, saying that Washington should not allow “the same people committing those war crimes to do the investigation,” referring to Israel.

Palestinian rights advocates in the United States have called on the Biden administration to demand an independent probe into the killing of Abu Akleh, saying that Israel should not be allowed to investigate itself.
Ahmad Abuznaid, executive director of the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights, said calls for investigations are “empty gestures” if the probe is to be left for Israel.
“You can’t ask the Israelis to investigate themselves when they’ve been abusing human rights for over 70 years and expect them to arrive at a different result that they’ve been arriving after all these decades,” Abuznaid told Al Jazeera.

“This must be condemned and investigated, and there must be accountability.”
Congressman Mark Pocan called the killing “shameful”.
The killing of American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh in the West Bank is shameful and must be investigated immediately. Journalists are vital to helping keep democracies free, and I hope those who are responsible are held accountable. https://t.co/v3ybXINWw5

“I’ve been a journalist in Jerusalem for more than 12 years – I learned from Shireen on all levels, not just journalism,” Rinawi told Al Jazeera.
“We lost Shireen because the killing of Palestinians has become an easy matter. There are no words to explain the pain of what every Palestinian and Arab journalist is going through, and especially those who worked with her and saw her high professionalism and manners.”
Rinawi said that instead of reporting on the news, journalists have become the news.

“The killing of veteran journalist Shireen Abu Akleh is a bloody reminder of the deadly system in which Israel locks Palestinians,” said Saleh Higazi, Amnesty International’s deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa.
Palestinians have been killed or injured as a result of the Israeli forces’ use of excessive force when policing protests or carrying out search and arrest raids, the statement continued, in cases that amount to extrajudicial executions – a crime under international law.
11 May 2022 - 12:01 GMT
Mujahed al-Saadi, a Palestinian journalist that was part of the group of reporters going into the Jenin refugee camp, said he was waiting for his colleagues to arrive before the shooting began.
“We were waiting for our colleagues to enter the refugee camp,” he said. “We chose a point that did not have confrontations between the Israeli army and the armed fighters. We waited for Shireen to put on all of her safety gear. She then reached us then we moved a few metres.
“Then within seconds, there was the first shot. I told them that we are being targeted, that we’ve been shot at. I turned and found Shireen on the ground. I found Shatha [Hanaysha] shielding herself by a tree and screaming. The shooting continued for more than three minutes. [Al Jazeera journalist] Ali [al-Samoudi] was injured, he was able to cross the street and get to a point of safety. The shooting towards Shatha continued while she was standing under the tree.
“We could not provide first aid to Shireen. The youth in the street came to us and tried to pull Shireen out but were also shot at. Whenever anyone moved forward, they were shot at.”
11 May 2022 - 11:40 GMT

11 May 2022 - 10:50 GMT
The spokesman of the Palestinian Authority, Ibrahim Milhim, said his government rejects any role for Israel in an investigation into Abu Akleh’s killing.

Witness and fellow journalist Shatha Hanaysha says journalists in the scene were pinned down by snipers when Abu Akleh was shot.
She told Al Jazeera: “We stood together in a collective way as journalists, then we started moving. We were shocked by the live ammunition fired at us, we reached an area that did not allow us to withdraw.”
“We were just facing the snipers. If they were not really willing to kill some of us, they could have started shooting before our arrival in this narrow area. I see this as a clear assassination of journalists,” she said.
“The one that killed Shireen was intended to kill her because he shot the bullet at an area of her body that was not protected,” Hanaysha also said.
11 May 2022 - 08:56 GMT
Hamas, the governing party of the Gaza Strip, has said that the killing of Abu Akleh by the Israeli occupation forces is their latest crime.

Omar Shakir, the Israel and Palestine director for Human Rights Watch, said Abu Akleh’s death by Israeli forces is not unusual.
“We know that Israeli forces systematically have used excessive force,” he told Al Jazeera.
“This is an event that needs to be understood in the context of this systemic practice and the killings of many other Palestinian journalists.”
Shakir went on to describe Israeli investigations as a “white-washed mechanism”.
“That is the assessment that’s been reached by human rights organisations including Israeli’s premier human rights organisation B’Tselem,” he said. “When news of crimes is reported, Israeli forces regularly say they’ll investigate. The reality is there is no accountability for those sorts of abuses when it comes to actions by the Israeli authorities.”
11 May 2022 - 07:53 GMT
Ali al-Samoudi, the Al Jazeera journalist who was also shot by Israeli forces next to Abu Akleh but is now in stable condition, said there was no presence of Palestinian armed fighters at the scene.
“We were going to film the Israeli army raid, and suddenly, they shot us without asking us to leave or stop filming,” he said.
“The first bullet hit me and the second bullet hit Shireen. They killed her in cold blood because they are killers and they specialise in killing only the Palestinian people.
“There was no Palestinian military resistance at all at the scene,” he added.
11 May 2022 - 07:35 GMT
The Israeli army confirmed it had conducted an operation early Wednesday in the Jenin refugee camp, but denied that it had deliberately targeted journalists.
“The [army,] of course, does not aim at journalists,” a military official said.
The army said there was an exchange of fire between suspects and security forces and that it was “investigating the event and looking into the possibility that journalists were hit by the Palestinian gunmen”.
Israeli foreign minister Yair Lapid said Israel has offered a joint investigation with the Palestinians.
We have offered the Palestinians a joint pathological investigation into the sad death of journalist Shireen Abu Aqla. Journalists must be protected in conflict zones and we all have a responsibility to get to the truth.

Al Jazeera reporters have offered their condolences to Abu Akleh’s family and mourned her loss.
“Shireen, for every Palestinian journalist and for every Arab journalist, is a model we lost today,” Al Jazeera journalist Tamer Mishal said. “The tragic pictures that we saw on social media, shot in the head, show that it came from an Israeli sniper who fired a bullet directly at her.”
“Till the very last second, Shireen Abu Akleh was professional and persevering,” he added.
The last message Abu Akleh sent to Al Jazeera was an email at 6:13am (03:13 GMT) in which she wrote: “Occupation forces storm Jenin and besiege a house in the Jabriyat neighbourhood. On the way there, I will bring you news as soon as the picture becomes clear.”

“There is total impunity in Israel, [and] we do not expect Israel to hold those responsible accountable.”
Nesseba said that what is needed is an international intervention”.
