Will new evidence force Israel to act on Abu Akleh’s killing?

-----

Al Jazeera has uncovered more evidence that a special Israeli military unit shot dead its journalist Shireen Abu Akleh.
This network has obtained an exclusive photo of the bullet that killed the Palestinian-American journalist in the Occupied West Bank last month.
Experts say the bullet is a type used by Israeli soldiers, and is designed to pierce body armour.
Other investigations suggest that Abu Akleh was deliberately targeted while doing her job as a journalist.
But will the mounting evidence force Israel into action?
And who can conduct a transparent and independent investigation?
