Genocide in Gaza: The coverage of Israel’s war

-----

In 17 years of The Listening Post, we have never seen a story anything like Israel’s war on Gaza.
It has been a turning point for the world order as we know it and its media ecosystem – which is why, since October 7, we have covered nothing else.
In this special edition, we compiled our reporting on the Gaza war over the past 12 weeks. The extent of the brutality, a genocide unfolding in plain sight; the sheer volume of disinformation, designed to defend the indefensible; and the complicity of so many Western news outlets – repeatedly exposed for failing to question Israeli propaganda, then spreading it.
