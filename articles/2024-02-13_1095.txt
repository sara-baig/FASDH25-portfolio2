An order by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) states Israel must take action to prevent acts of genocide and must ensure the delivery of aid to civilians in Gaza.
But the military has largely ignored the ruling and, if anything, has intensified its bombing campaign.
What can be done to force Israel to comply?
