Israel’s Ben-Gvir enters Al-Aqsa: Why was it seen as provocative?

-----

Israel’s far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir entered the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in occupied East Jerusalem in a move Palestinians called a “deliberate provocation”, ignoring warnings from Israeli politicians that his appearance at the holy site would inflame tensions.
Ben-Gvir said he would not “surrender to the threats of Hamas” after the Palestinian group warned that his entrance to the site on Tuesday would cross a “red line”.
The minister, widely regarded as a provocateur, has previously called for the displacement of Palestinians.
Let’s take a look at why his entrance to Al-Aqsa Mosque compound is so controversial:
