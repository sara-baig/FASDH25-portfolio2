Will we see a major Israeli assault in the occupied West Bank?

-----


Violence in the occupied West Bank has reached a level not seen in a generation; an Israeli military raid in the Jenin refugee camp became an hours-long armed confrontation inside the city. Seven Palestinians were killed, more than 100 others wounded, and the violence has only continued to escalate. All in a year during which more than 160 Palestinians have been killed, including 26 children.
