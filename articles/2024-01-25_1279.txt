Is Israel’s war on Gaza a watershed moment in history?

-----

Israel is driving ahead with its war on Gaza that many have called a genocide.
The vast majority of people it has killed are Palestinian civilians, while its military campaign is failing to destroy Hamas.
As the world watches, the Israeli army is carrying out its slaughter without restraint using Western-supplied weapons.
So, is this a pivotal point in history for both the Palestinian people and Israel?
