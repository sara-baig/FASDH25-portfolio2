Israel’s war on Gaza: List of key events, day 189

-----

Here’s how things stand on Friday, April 12, 2024:
The non-profit American Near East Refugee Aid (Anera) has resumed Gaza operations “after a temporary pause”.
“As you know, the decision to temporarily pause our operations was not an easy one,” Sean Carroll, the president and CEO of Anera, said in a statement. “We followed the direction of our staff in Gaza, who’ve faced death, loss, and destruction since the start of the war. After the killing of Anera staff member Mousa Shawwa, followed by the attack that killed seven aid workers from World Central Kitchen, we made the difficult but necessary decision to pause aid operations on April 2.”
Separately, a specialised UN committee failed to reach a consensus on a bid by Palestinians for full UN membership. During its closed-door meeting “there was no consensus,” said Maltese ambassador Vanessa Frazier, who holds the council’s rotating presidency for April. However, two-thirds of the members were in favour of full membership, she said on Thursday, without specifying which countries.
