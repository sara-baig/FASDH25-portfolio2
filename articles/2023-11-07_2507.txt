Is Israel’s Gaza war the deadliest conflict for children in modern times?

-----

In late October, the international nonprofit Save the Children reported that the number of children killed in the Gaza Strip over three weeks of Israel’s bombardment had surpassed the annual number of children killed in global conflict zones every year since 2019.
Since then, the number of tiny bodies wrapped in white shrouds and surrounded by grieving family members has only grown as Israel has also launched a ground offensive, adding artillery fire to the destruction unleashed by its missiles.
Yet as the war rages on a month after it started, even the numbers don’t fully reveal the scale at which Gaza’s children have been killed.
Here is how the deaths compare with some other major conflicts in recent years. All have been horrific and devastating for children. Still, Gaza stands out. Starkly.
