Will there ever be justice for Shireen Abu Akleh?

-----


It’s been one year since Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was killed while doing her job. Independent investigations have found it was Israeli forces who shot her. After Israeli and United States investigations found the killing was unintentional, Shireen’s family and colleagues continued to call for an independent probe. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation announced it was launching one in November, but it’s unclear where that stands. What has happened to the investigation, and will there ever be justice for Shireen Abu Akleh’s killing?
