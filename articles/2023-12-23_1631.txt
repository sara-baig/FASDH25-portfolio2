Will motion passed by UN Security Council on Gaza have any impact?

-----

The United Nations Security Council has passed a motion on the war on Gaza.
It comes after two months of Israeli attacks that have killed more than 20,000 Palestinians.
The resolution – weakened by pressure from the United States – calls for more aid but not for Israel to stop its bombardment.
So, will it have any impact?
