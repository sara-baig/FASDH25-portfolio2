Desert Smugglers: Palestiniansâ€™ perilous journeys to Israel

-----

Hamouda and his cousin Ismail drive undocumented workers across the border from Palestine into Israel.
They speed across the rocky landscape, dodging Israeli military patrols and risking their lives on a daily basis. Spotters on the hills look out for the soldiers. If the drivers are caught, they will be sent to a military prison.
Living in poverty under Israeli occupation and with no chance of a work permit, Hamouda says he has no choice but to brave the dangers to support his family.
Desert Smugglers is a film by Daniel Carsenty and Mohammed Abugeth.
