What will be the outcome of the ICJ genocide case against Israel?

-----

A two-day public hearing of South Africa’s genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has concluded.
South Africa laid out a list of genocidal acts by Israel on the first day of hearing on Thursday – while Israel defended itself on Friday.
Now, the court has begun deliberations.
It will decide whether South Africa’s case is strong enough to issue a provisional measure to stop the Israeli military’s attacks on Gaza.
So, what’s the likely outcome of this case?
