Behind the scenes: How the Israel-Hamas truce deal came together

-----

Shortly after the Hamas group took captives during their deadly assault on southern Israel on October 7, the government of Qatar contacted the White House with a request: Form a small team of advisers to help get the captives freed.
That effort, which began in the days after the captives were taken, finally bore fruit with the announcement of a truce mediated by Qatar and EgyptÂ and agreed byÂ Israel, Hamas and the United States.
Here is how it unfolded, as pieced together by Al Jazeera. Some of these details are based on Reuters interviews with two US officials.



ðŸ“¢ We facilitated the release of 2 more hostages, transporting them out of #Gaza this evening.
Our role as a neutral intermediary makes this work possible & we are ready to facilitate any future release.
We hope that they will soon be back with their loved ones.
