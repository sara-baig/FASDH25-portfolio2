Eleven people have been killed in three separate attacks by Palestinians in Israel in a little more than a week.
The latest shooting left five dead in an ultra-Orthodox Jewish town east of Tel Aviv.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas warned of repeat incidents as Muslims, Jews and Christians prepare for Ramadan, Passover and Easter.
