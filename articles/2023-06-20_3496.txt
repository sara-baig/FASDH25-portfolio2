What is behind the rise in violence in the occupied West Bank?

-----

This year has been marked by the Israeli military’s escalations in the occupied West Bank – the likes of which have not been seen in decades.
Israel’s far-right government has increased its raids against Palestinians by launching military operations that often result in people being killed and wounded.
On Monday, the air was filled with the sounds of whirring blades from combat helicopters, live ammunition, and stun grenades.
Israeli forces had launched an attack against the Jenin refugee camp that would last for hours.
Last year, an Israeli sniper shot and killed veteran Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh who was wearing her full press gear.
The city of Jenin has become symbolic of the Palestinian resistance and in recent years, several armed groups have emerged from there.
Israel says it is going after these groups that pose a threat to its security.
But Palestinians say they are the ones paying a high price.
So, is there a risk of a further escalation?
