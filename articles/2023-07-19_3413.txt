Shooting the Messenger: Journalism under fire by the Israeli army

-----

Media freedom is under attack globally and the occupied Palestinian territories have seen many journalists killed in the line of duty. In May 2022, the Israeli army shot dead Al Jazeera correspondent Shireen Abu Akleh. It has reportedly killed more than 155 journalists in Palestine since 2000, with apparent impunity. At least 100 of those were killed in Gaza since Israelâ€™s war on the Strip began on 7 October 2023, according to figures released by government media office in Gaza by end of December 2023.
This film tells the story of four other Palestinian journalists: Reuters cameraman Fadel Shana, killed by an Israeli tank shell in Gaza in April 2008; Muath Amarneh, shot in the eye by a sniper in Hebron in November 2019; Yaser Murtaja, also killed by a sniper in Rafah in 2018; and Nazih Dawarzeh, shot dead in Nablus in 2003.
