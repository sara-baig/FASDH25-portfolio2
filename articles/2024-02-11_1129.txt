Why does the US refuse to call for a ceasefire in Gaza?

-----

The United States’ support for Israel’s war on Gaza makes the country look ineffectual and hypocritical to the rest of the world, according to Harvard University professor Stephen Walt, co-author of The Israel Lobby and US Foreign Policy.
Walt tells host Steve Clemons that Israel and the US-Israel relationship have changed over the decades, but US President Joe Biden is holding on to a view of Israel formed in the West in the 1970s.
By rejecting a ceasefire, the US looks like it “encourages conflict” instead of being a peacemaker, Walt argues, especially since Israel has no political strategy for resolving the Palestinian question.
