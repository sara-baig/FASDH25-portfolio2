Mapping protests in solidarity with Palestine against Is­rael’s assault

-----

Demonstrators around the globe have taken to the streets to demand an end to Israel’s bombardment of Gaza.
Israel launched air raids on the besieged Gaza Strip after the Palestinian group Hamas, which governs the territory, carried out a brutal attack on southern Israel on October 7, killing at least 1,400 people, according to Israeli authorities.
At least 2,800 people have been killed in the responding Israeli assault on Gaza, according to Palestinian authorities, and an estimated one million people were displaced in Gaza in the first week of the conflict, according to the United Nations.
Around the world, protests took place in multiple cities, with demonstrators chanting “Free Palestine” and calling for an end to Israel’s illegal occupation of Palestinian land.
