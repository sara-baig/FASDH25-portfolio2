Praying for Armageddon: How evangelicals affect the Middle East

-----

Watch episode 1 here.
The second episode of Praying for Armageddon examines the dangerous consequences of the fusion between evangelical Christians and US politics.
It shows not only how the very fabric of US democracy is weakened but also highlights the devastating impact religion wields on US foreign policy.
Expressing concerns about the influence of evangelical Christians in the US military, retired US Army Colonel Larry Wilkerson who was a former adviser to General Colin Powell, says: “The most vivid danger in all of this, I think, is the special relationship with Israel… They are looking for the US relationship with Israel, ultimately to bring about Armageddon and the rapture and Christ’s thousand-year reign.”
As evangelicals fuel the volatile situation in the Middle East, Israel launches a devastating 11-day military offensive on Gaza in May 2021.
“The countdown to Armageddon has begun,” says Pastor Robert Jeffress.
Praying for Armageddon Episode 2 is a documentary film by Tonje Hessen Schei.
