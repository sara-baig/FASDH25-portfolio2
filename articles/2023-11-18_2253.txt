What’s the impact of the war on Gaza on the Palestinian economy?

-----

The Palestinian territories are dependent on Israel for their labour and goods markets and for basic services like water and electricity.
They are locked in a cycle of underdevelopment caused by decades of Israeli restrictions and occupation.
Palestinian GDP stood at just over $20bn last year. By comparison, Israel’s economy is worth nearly $500bn.
The UN says the war on Gaza could set back development by as much as 16 years.
We look at the high cost of the Israel-Gaza war.
Plus, how is Lebanon’s economy being affected by the spillover of the conflict?
