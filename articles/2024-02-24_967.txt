Israel’s war on Gaza updates: War cabinet mulls truce proposed in Paris

-----

This live page is now closed. Follow along with our ongoing coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza here.
We will be closing the live blog soon. Here’s a recap of the day’s main events.
Al Jazeera’s Hamadah Salhut has the latest on the mass demonstrations taking place on the streets of Tel Aviv:





Earlier, the Israeli army attacked Beit Lahiya in the far north of the Gaza Strip.
A video posted to Instagram by Palestinian journalist Abdul Qader Sabah shows the immediate aftermath of that attack. It is unclear at this time whether there were any deaths or injuries as a result.
This video has been verified by Al Jazeera’s fact-checking unit.

Israeli media outlet Ynet is reporting that, at the end of a telephone consultation, a team of Israeli negotiators will be sent to Doha in the coming days to continue talks over a deal to reach a truce in the Gaza war and secure the release of Israeli captives held in Gaza.
We now have more for you from Yemeni military spokesperson Yahya Saree.
“The Yemeni Armed Forces, along with all the great Yemeni people, persist in upholding their religious, moral and humanitarian duties towards the Palestinian people,” he said.
“Their military operations will not stop unless the aggression stops and the siege on the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is lifted.”
The colourful kites fluttering in the skies of Rafah belie the reality they soar over: ragged tents packed tightly together and lines of people trying to find food, water and firewood.
Running in and out of it all are children, brief smiles illuminating their exhausted faces as they look up at their flying miracles.
That such a simple toy can bring them moments of joy is in and of itself a miracle – and proof of the undefeatable spirit of children who manage this in the midst of rubble, death, displacement, hunger and freezing cold as Israel’s brutal war on Gaza nears five months.

Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthis targeted MV Torm Thor, a US-flagged, owned and operated oil tanker, in the Gulf of Aden, the group’s military spokesman Yahya Sarea has said.

We will bring you more on this shortly.

We’ve been reporting on ongoing protests on the streets of Israel, with demonstrations denouncing Prime Minister Netanyahu and demanding that Israeli captives held in Gaza be brought home.
The Israeli police say they have arrested 21 people near the Kirya complex in Tel Aviv, rising from five earlier in the night. The police say this demonstration was illegal, with protesters blocking roads and clashing with its personnel.
“At the same time as the approved protest, a number of protesters gathered at the intersection illegally and began to break the order and confront the police. At the end of the approved protest, most of the protesters dispersed, when dozens of the protesters began to descend on the Kaplan intersection and violated the order along with the rest of the protesters who were present there,” the Israeli police wrote on X.
The US Central Command says American and UK forces with support from its western allies, have hit 18 Houthi targets.
“These strikes from this multilateral coalition targeted areas used by the Houthis to attack international merchant vessels and naval ships in the region,” CENTCOM said in a post on X.
“Illegal Houthi attacks have disrupted humanitarian aid bound for Yemen, harmed Middle Eastern economies, and caused environmental damage.”
Earlier, the Houthi-affiliated media outlet Al-Masirah said US and UK forces carried out three raids in the capital Sanaa.

The aid that is coming in is very limited for the large number of people here in southern Gaza.
People here are lining up for long hours on a daily basis just to have a very small parcel of food and a bottle of water.
Sometimes, adults are forgoing meals so their children will have sufficient food to eat.
In the north, the situation is more chaotic because people there have not received many humanitarian supplies since the beginning of this conflict.
The legal rights organisation denounces the killing of Dana Yaghy with 40 members of her family in the besieged Gaza Strip.

The 27-year-old was killed a few days after her colleague Nour Abu Al-Nour, “both fantastic young lawyers”, the organisation says.

We’ve been reporting on ass demonstrations on Israeli streets against Prime Minister Netanyahu’s government and its failure to bring Israeli captives held in Gaza home.
Israel police say they have arrested at five people during protests in Tel Aviv.
“Five rioters were arrested near the Kariya compound in Tel Aviv … a number of protesters, who are not among the families of the abducted, blocked traffic and sat down on the road when they did not obey the police’s instructions,” the police said in a post on X.
Video verified by Al Jazeera, posted on X by an Israeli journalist, shows police in Tel Aviv arresting one of the protest leaders:

The Lebanese group says that it targeted the Israeli army’s “headquarters of the Beit Hillal Battalion of the 769th Eastern Regional Brigade” with Katyusha rockets.
In a break from the regular statements published by Hezbollah, the group says that this attack was carried out “in response to the enemy’s attacks on villages and civilian homes, especially in the town of Baraachit”.
Meanwhile, our correspondent, along with Israeli media, reports that more than 20 rockets were fired from southern Lebanon towards the Kiryat Shmona settlement in northern Israel.
Al Jazeera’s correspondent also reported that sirens sounded in several areas in the Upper Galilee on the border with Lebanon.
“Only a combination of military pressure and firm negotiations will lead to the release of our hostages, the elimination of Hamas and the achievement of all the war’s objectives,” the Israeli prime minister says on X.
On the negotiations, under way in Paris between the US, Qatar, Egypt, Hamas and Israel, he said, “We are working to obtain another outline for the release of our hostages, as well as the completion of the elimination of the Hamas battalions in Rafah. That is why I sent a delegation to Paris and tonight we will discuss the next steps in the negotiations.”
Meanwhile, demonstrators have flooded the streets of Tel Avi protesting against his government and demanding the return of the Israeli captives still held in Gaza by Hamas and other Palestinian factions.
Mistaclim, a group of Israeli anti-occupation activists, has listed several incidents wherein settlers attacked Palestinians or their property in the occupied West Bank.
In the last few days, the group said, in Shaeb al-Botum, settlers hurled stones, tried to run over a flock of sheep, and took the father of the family and his son to the settlement. Other attacks, according to Mistaclim, include:
