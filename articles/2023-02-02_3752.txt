Is Israel pushing Palestinians to the brink of Intifada?

-----


US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has wrapped up his visit to ease tensions in the Middle East after pledging an “ironclad” US support for Israel. His trip came amid violence between Israelis and Palestinians, with the Israeli military carrying out deadly raids in the occupied West Bank. Israel has also announced punitive measures against Palestinians after a gunman killed seven Israelis in occupied East Jerusalem. The attack came a week after Israel’s deadly military raid in Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank and the killing of 10 Palestinians.
