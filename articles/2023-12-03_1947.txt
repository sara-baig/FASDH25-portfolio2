From north to south, nowhere safe in Gaza as 700 killed in 24 hours

-----

Israel’s war on Gaza is escalating, leaving death and devastation across the besieged strip.
At least 700 Palestinians have been killed in the past 24 hours – one of the highest daily death tolls since the war began on October 7.
From the north to the south, Palestinians in Gaza say nowhere is safe.
The Israeli military targeted the Jabalia refugee camp for a second day. Several homes were destroyed, killing dozens of people. More are buried under the rubble.
Israel has also called on residents from certain neighbourhoods in Khan Younis in southern Gaza to evacuate. Roads leading to other parts of the city or further south have been destroyed or heavily damaged.
More than 15,500 people have been confirmed killed in Gaza since the start of the conflict, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza.
A Palestinian Civil Defence spokesperson told Al Jazeera that conditions across Gaza are “beyond dire”, warning that rescuers lack the resources to reach all victims of Israeli bombardment.
“There are dozens of civilians being killed in every single air strike. Hundreds are also being wounded,” said Mahmoud Basal.
