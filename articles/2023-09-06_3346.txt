Libya and Israel have no formal diplomatic relations – in fact, under Libyan law, it is illegal to hold any unauthorised discussions with Israeli officials. Yet, in August, Libyan Foreign Minister Najla al-Mangoush met Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen in Rome, in what she thought was a secret meeting. Then, the news got out. Protests erupted in several cities across Libya, Mangoush was fired and fled the country for what she claimed were security reasons.
