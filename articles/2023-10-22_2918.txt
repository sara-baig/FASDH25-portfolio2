Saturday marked the worst day in recent fighting along Israel’s northern border with Lebanon, after six Hezbollah fighters were killed.
The Iranian-backed group and Israel have been exchanging fire across that border since Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7.
So what could happen if it launches a full offensive?
