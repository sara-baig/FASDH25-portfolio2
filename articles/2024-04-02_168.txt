Why is Israel targeting Al Jazeera?

-----

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised to take Al Jazeera off air in Israel.
Calling it a “terror channel”, he accused the network of harming national security and actively participating in the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel.
Al Jazeera says the accusations are slanderous, and jeporadise the rights and safety of its workers worldwide.
Media freedom groups are alarmed and warn Israel is trying to censor coverage of the war in Gaza.
But this isn’t the first time Israel has targeted Al Jazeera or its journalists.
So how will this ban impact its coverage? And what are the wider implications for the broadcaster?
