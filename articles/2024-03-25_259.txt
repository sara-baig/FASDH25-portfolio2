Will UNRWA collapse without US support?

-----

The United Nations Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, provides humanitarian support to millions of Palestinian refugees.
Israel’s war on Gaza has made its work even more vital. But the agency is under pressure.
The United States has suspended its funding to the agency after Israel said some UNRWA employees were involved in the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on October 7.
The agency has launched an investigation into the allegations.
The loss of US support could prove devastating for the agency. Can UNRWA continue its work without its biggest donor?
