How can Israel’s war on Gaza be allowed to continue?

-----

As Israel’s brutal war on Gaza continues, the 2.3 million residents of the besieged Palestinian territory face the imminent risk of famine.
More than 31,800 people have been killed and 74,000 others wounded in the Israeli assault on Gaza since October 7.
The wounded rely on a health system that’s either destroyed or under attack by Israeli forces.
