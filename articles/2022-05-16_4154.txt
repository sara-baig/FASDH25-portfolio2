Mapping Shireen Abu Akleh solidarity protests

Demonstrators around the world have taken to the streets to protest against the killing of veteran Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh.
Abu Akleh, 51, was fatally shot on May 11 when Israeli forces opened fire on journalists reporting on raids in the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank.
Following Abu Aklehâ€™s death, a number of international organisations including the United Nations called for an independent investigation, while people gathered in cities such as London to condemn the killing and to protest against the Israeli occupation of Palestine.
