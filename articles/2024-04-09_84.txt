Is Germany complicit in Israel’s war on Gaza?

-----

Nicaragua has asked the International Court of Justice to order Germany to stop supplying Israel with weapons.
The case joins two others involving Israel already before the court.
Nicaragua’s case is more broad, drawing on both the Genocide and Geneva Conventions, and is notable for being the first to involve two countries not directly involved in the alleged atrocities.
Governments around the world will undoubtedly take notice.
So, what does this case mean for other countries that contribute to Israel’s extensive military network?
