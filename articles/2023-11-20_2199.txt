What’s the impact of the Houthis hijacking a ship in the Red Sea?

-----

A partly Israeli-owned cargo vessel has been hijacked by Yemen’s Houthi rebels in the Red Sea.
The Iran-backed Houthis say the move was a response to Israel’s assault on Gaza.
Israel described the incident as an “Iranian act of terrorism”. Tehran has rejected the allegation.
So, what impact could this have? And what are the possible military and economic implications?
