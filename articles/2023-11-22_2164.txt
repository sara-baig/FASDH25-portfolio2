Israel-Hamas deal: Which captives, Palestinian prisoners could be freed?

-----

Israel and Hamas have agreed to a four-day pause in fighting that includes an exchange of some of the captives taken during the October 7 Hamas attack for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody.
Hereâ€™s what we know about the captives and prisoners:
More than 200 captives were taken by Hamas during its October 7 attack. Of these, about 50 will be released under the deal agreed to on Wednesday. Reuters reported that a senior US official spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity, saying that there is anticipation that the actual number of captives released will be higher than 50.
In the days before the deal, Hamas had released four captives. Israel rescued one soldier who had been abducted and said it had found the bodies of two other captives.
The truce calls for 150 Palestinian prisoners to be released from Israeli jails. About 5,200 Palestinians were in Israeli prisons before October 7. After the outbreak of violence on October 7, another 3,000 were arrested, including 145 children and 95 women.
