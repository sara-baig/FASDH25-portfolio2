The Take: When it comes to Gaza, when is it called a war crime?

-----


An Israeli air attack hit Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City on Tuesday night, according to officials there. The Israeli military denies responsibility but Gaza’s health ministry puts the blame squarely on them, saying at least 500 people are dead. The Palestinian Civil Defence said the attack was unprecedented. The hospital is in the area where the Israeli military had ordered all Palestinian residents to go – prompting discussions of war crimes even before the air strike. So, as Israel’s siege on Gaza continues we ask the question: where is international law?
