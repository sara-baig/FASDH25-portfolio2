Israel’s Automated Occupation: Jerusalem

-----

Palestinian existence in Jerusalem is under threat – carefully watched, recorded and restricted. In the Old City’s narrow streets and alleys, cameras are inescapable.
In the second episode of a two-part special, Tariq Nafi reports from the occupied West Bank, on how Israel’s surveillance machine infiltrates the lives of Palestinians. He also speaks with a former Israeli lieutenant in Unit 8200 – the elite intelligence unit responsible for spying on Palestinians.
