At least seven Palestinians were injured during the confrontations, according to the health ministry, including three with live bullets and two with rubber-coated bullets who were transferred to hospital for treatment.
The Israeli army had raided Halhul three hours before the killing, shut down the main road, fired tear gas and carried out arrests, according to local journalists.
Israeli forces routinely raid Palestinian towns and villages in the West Bank, including to carry out arrests. At least 13 Palestinians were arrested overnight on Thursday in military raids in various areas.
Such raids often lead to the killing or injury of Palestinians as confrontations break out with the army. Since the start of 2022, Israeli forces have killed at least 62 Palestinians in the West Bank, according to the Ministry of Health.
