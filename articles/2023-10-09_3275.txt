Hours after the deadly Hamas attack inside Israel, US President Joe Biden promised ‘rock-solid and unwavering’ support to its closest ally in the Middle East.
Washington, which provides about $3bn in annual military aid to Israel, has ordered the movement of military ships and aircraft closer to Israel as a show of support following Saturday’s attack by the Palestinian armed group.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called the Hamas attack a “massive terrorist attack” in an interview with ABC News on Sunday. “We have immediately engaged our Israeli partners and allies. President [Joe] Biden was on the phone with Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu early yesterday to assure him of our full support,” he added.

Hamas has labelled the US announcement as “aggression” against Palestinians.
“The announcement of the US that it will provide an aircraft carrier to support the occupation [Israel] is actual participation in the aggression against our people,” the group said in a statement on Sunday.
