Iran’s Kharazi: Defining red lines before an Israeli aggression

-----

Since the start of Israel’s war on Gaza after Hamas’s surprise attack on October 7, Iran’s role has been a subject of speculation. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, has denied the country’s involvement but labelled the offensive a success.
The conflict has killed thousands and left nearly two million displaced. After a weeklong truce, Israeli attacks recommenced, casting the spotlight on Iran’s next moves.
For an in-depth look at the Iranian position on these rapidly evolving events, Kamal Kharazi, Iran’s former foreign minister and current adviser to the supreme leader, talks to Al Jazeera.
