Will Israel obey the ruling of the UN’s top court?

-----

The United Nation’s top court has ordered Israel to take measures to prevent genocide in Gaza and allow in humanitarian aid.
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued the ruling on Friday in a case filed by South Africa.
Judges voted overwhelmingly in favour of six emergency measures that included asking Israel to punish those inciting genocide.
So, how will this ruling impact Israel’s war on Gaza? And how might other countries pressure Israel to comply?
