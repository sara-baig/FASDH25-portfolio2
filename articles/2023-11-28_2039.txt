What would it take for an even longer ceasefire in Gaza?

-----

Israel and Hamas agreed to extend a four-day truce in Gaza by two more days, after Hamas pledged to free more Israeli captives in exchange for Israel releasing more Palestinian prisoners.
For the people of Gaza, it means more relief from bombardment and an increase in humanitarian supplies to Gaza.
So what happens next? What would both sides need to give up to bring about a longer peace?
Or is Israel simply going to return to war?
