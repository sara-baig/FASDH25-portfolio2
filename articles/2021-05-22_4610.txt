What’s next after Gaza ceasefire?

-----

A ceasefire is holding for now over Gaza, but the Israeli military and Hamas have warned that attacks will resume if the other side breaks the truce.
Eleven days of fighting killed at least 248 Palestinians and 13 people in Israel,  left thousands of families homeless in Gaza, and destroyed vital infrastructure.
US President Joe Biden has promised to help, adding he hopes the ceasefire will help restart diplomatic moves towards peace.
But what will it take to achieve a lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians?
