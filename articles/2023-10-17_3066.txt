At least 2,808 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip in a blistering air assault launched by Israel last week after Hamas carried out a bloody attack on Israel that left more than 1,400 people dead.
Israel has attacked Gaza for an 11th day in a row as the besieged Palestinian enclave faces a growing humanitarian catastrophe.
At least 57 people have also been killed in the occupied West Bank area.
An Israeli army spokesperson has renewed orders for Palestinians in northern Gaza ‚Äì where some 1.1 million people live ‚Äì to flee south, raising fears that an Israeli ground operation could be imminent.
Israel says as many as 300,000 Israeli troops are massed near Gaza and are readying for war with Hamas.
