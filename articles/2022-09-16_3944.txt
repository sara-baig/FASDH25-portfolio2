Sabra and Shatila massacre: What happened in Lebanon in 1982?

-----

It was one of the most harrowing massacres committed in the Lebanese civil war, a conflict known for its brutality.
Shatila, a Palestinian refugee camp, and the adjacent neighbourhood of Sabra are located southwest of Lebanon’s capital city Beirut.
The refugees were victims of the 1948 Nakba, or “catastrophe” in Arabic, fleeing the violent ethnic cleansing of Palestine by Zionist militias as Israel was formed.
But between September 16 and 18, 1982, the refugees, now living in Shatila and Sabra, along with Lebanese civilians, were attacked by a right-wing Lebanese militia, in coordination with the Israeli army.
Between 2,000 and 3,500 people were killed.
