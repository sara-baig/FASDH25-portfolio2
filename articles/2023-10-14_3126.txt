The crucial context of Israel’s war on Gaza

-----

What we are seeing in the occupied Gaza Strip and Israel has no precedent – the
barbarism, the talk of vengeance, the war crimes. And the signs, all too familiar ones, of journalists succumbing to the pressures under the powers that be.
In this special episode, we delve into the news coverage of the war in Palestine and Israel. We examine the narratives that have emerged since Hamas’s surprise attack – a seismic news event that is destined to take ownership of the date on which it happened – October 7, 2023.
