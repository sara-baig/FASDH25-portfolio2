Breaking down Israel’s regulations on foreigners in the West Bank

-----

Israel has published a draft set of rules that would restrict the entry of foreigners to the occupied West Bank.
The regulations, which are set to come into effect next month, would affect foreigners wishing to visit, do business, reunite, and reside with their Palestinian families, work or volunteer in the West Bank, or study or teach at Palestinian academic institutions.
Israeli authorities have been forced to delay the regulations (PDF), which were set to come into effect on Monday, after widespread criticism. Authorities amended and withdrew some of the most restrictive sections, such as a rule that would have forced a foreigner to inform Israel within 30 days of starting a relationship with a Palestinian in the West Bank.
However, Palestinian legal experts, academics and digital rights groups have expressed outrage over the incoming Israeli policy, which they say further complicates the rules of movement, and adds restrictions to an already convoluted system.
HaMoked, a Jerusalem-based human rights organisation, criticised the new rules, saying that Israel will “prevent thousands of families from living together for blatantly political reasons”.
“The Israeli military’s procedure on the entry of foreigners to the West Bank violates Israel’s international legal obligations and HaMoked will continue its legal challenge of it,” the group tweeted.
