Is a third Intifada on the way?

-----

Two intifadas, or mass Palestinian uprisings, have happened in the past, both fuelled by anger at Israeli occupation and oppression.
Some now see the beginnings of a third one.
Anger is growing at intensifying Israeli air attacks on Gaza, killing dozens of people each day.
And in an unprecedented escalation, Jews and Palestinians are turning on each other in mixed cities across Israel.
Mobs have attacked homes, synagogues and Muslim cemeteries.
Can this tension be contained?
