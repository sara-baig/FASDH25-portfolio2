Genocide in Gaza: The context

-----

After three months of destruction, displacement and the killing of Palestinians, we take a deep dive into the way the Gaza story has been covered.
Since the attacks on October 7, The Listening Post has interviewed a range of experts on the news coverage – what’s missing in it, and how it has helped enable the crimes being waged on Palestinians in Gaza.
In this special edition, we’ve compiled three interviews – with one journalist, one expert on human rights and another on digital rights. They talk us through the way the media – through their news coverage – have helped pave the way to a genocide.
