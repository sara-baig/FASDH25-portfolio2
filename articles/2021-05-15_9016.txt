Israeli air raid flattens Gaza building housing Al Jazeera

-----

Israel’s bombardment of the Gaza Strip entered its sixth consecutive day, with air raids hitting a refugee camp – killing at least 10 Palestinians, including eight children – and flattening a high-rise building housing the offices of media organisations, including Al Jazeera.
In a televised speech Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel will continue to strike Gaza “as long as necessary”.
Meanwhile, Palestinians on Saturday gathered in parts of the occupied West Bank to protest against continued Israeli occupation and the ongoing bombardment of Gaza.
At least 145 Palestinians, including 41 children, have been killed in the Gaza Strip since Monday. Some 950 others have been wounded. In the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces have killed at least 13 Palestinians.
At least 10 people in Israel have also been killed, with two new deaths reported on Saturday. The Israeli army said hundreds of rockets have been fired from Gaza towards various locations in Israel and they have added reinforcements near the enclave.
Thousands of Palestinian families are taking shelter in United Nations-run schools in northern Gaza amid the Israeli offensive.
Here are the latest updates:

In Indian-administered Kashmir, the police have started a crackdown on pro-Palestine protesters and detained at least 20 of them, officials said.
A number of people took to streets in the main city of Srinagar post congregational Friday prayers carrying Palestinian flags.
“How can we be silent when they (Israel) are killing children in Gaza. Every human on earth should stand up for them. This is about showing humanity and solidarity, but we are not even able to do that due to fear,” a 25-year-old resident Illyas, a resident of Srinagar, told Al Jazeera.
Meanwhile, Indian security forces detained several people including an artist Mudasir Gull – who had created graffiti in support of Palestine on an iron bridge.

Al Jazeera’s Safwat al-Kahlout, reporting from Gaza in the early morning hours of Sunday, said Israel had carried out new air raids in the centre of Gaza City.
The attacks hit a main road and two residential buildings, “this time without warning”, Kahlout said. He said three bodies had been transported to al-Shifa Hospital, according to hospital officials.
“They still believe that there are more people missing under the rubble of the destroyed two houses … They are still trying to pull the bodies from under the rubble.” Minutes before the Israeli attacks, Palestinian rocket-fire resumed towards Tel Aviv and other cities, al-Kahlout said.

“The Secretary-General reminds all sides that any indiscriminate targeting of civilian and media structures violates international law and must be avoided at all costs,” he said.

In a telephone conversation with Hamas leader Ismail Haniya, the commander of the al-Quds Brigade of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, General Esmail Qa’ani, has assured Hamas of his full support, Iranian state media reported.
Haniya thanked Iran for its support and said, according to al-Alam news channel, that the fight against Israel was not just Hamas’s but of the entire Islamic world.
Nevertheless, Iran is keeping a low profile in the latest conflict. One reason, according to observers, is the nuclear negotiations, which Tehran does not want to jeopardise.
15 May 2021 - 21:48 GMT
Hamas chief Ismail Haniya says the group repeatedly warned Israel not to touch Al-Aqsa Mosque.
“We have repeatedly warned the enemy not to touch Al-Aqsa Mosque, which is our qibla, our identity, our belief, and the trigger of our revolutions,” Haniya said in a video conference in Qatar’s capital, Doha, in support of Palestinians.
He said that Al-Aqsa Mosque is the group’s “red line” and it told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to play with fire.
“Jerusalem and Al-Aqsa Mosque form the basis of the struggle against Zionism,” he said, and thanked Qatar for helping the Palestinian people.

Sawsan Zaher, deputy general director of the Haifa-based rights group Adalah, says she takes issue with the portrayal in some media of recent violence between Palestinian citizens of Israel and Israeli Jews as “inter-communal violence”.
She told Al Jazeera much of the violence has been largely characterised by systematic Israeli racial discrimination against Palestinians, with Israeli police even accompanying settlers while they attacked Palestinians in cities such as Lod.



“We are talking about organised right-wing settler extreme violence, by settlers that are residents outside of mixed cites and outside of Arab towns, that are organising through social media calling each other to arrange where they will attack tonight and tomorrow, at what time, what to wear, what weapons to bring, and Arab properties that should be attacked,” she said.
“They are being accompanied by the police, they arrive in right-wing buses to mixed cities with police, and they are not being arrested by the police.”
15 May 2021 - 21:35 GMT
The US Senate Foreign Relations Committee said in a statement that “Israeli authorities must continue taking the conscientious practice of giving advance warning of its attacks to reduce the risk of harm to the innocent”.
While “Israel has every right to self-defence from terrorists committed to wipe her off the face of the map … there must be a full accounting of actions that have led to civilian deaths and destruction of media outlets,” it said.

The protesters in Sheikh Jarrah painted a map of Palestine and flew balloons bearing the colours of the Palestinian flag.
At least one person was arrested.
Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah were singing, painting murals, and flying balloons when Israeli forces attacked. Apparently Palestinian joy is a crime.

But with just one elevator working in al-Jalaa tower, an 11-storey building in Gaza City housing some 60 residential apartments and a number of offices, including those of Al Jazeera Media Network and The Associated Press, al-Sayed made a dash for the stairs.

Al Jazeera’s Safwat al-Kahlout, reporting from Gaza City, said Israeli shelling could be heard in northern Gaza near the Israeli border.
“More people are evacuating their homes, especially those who live near the border. Earlier two more residential buildings were evacuated and bombarded,” al-Kahlout said.

“Palestinian fighter groups are retaliating around the clock with the same intensity as Israeli fire.”

Israel has been “scaling up” its attacks, Al Jazeera’s Safwat al-Kahlout, reporting from Gaza City, said.
“They started with low scale bombardments, low scale targets, but now they’ve started hitting high buildings with media outlets,” al-Kahlout said, adding that armed groups in Gaza have maintained their counterattacks with rockets.
“The Palestinian fighting group considers the targeting of these residential buildings one of the red lines Israel has crossed. Hamas’ spokesperson said that they will keep hitting Tel Aviv and other cities.”

The roads outside the mosque were gridlocked with cars heading to the protest site. Qatari security personnel were on duty managing crowds and traffic.
Reem Alghoul, 28, a Palestinian living in Doha, told Al Jazeera she is heartbroken and angry by what is happening.
“As a proud Palestinian, by being at this protest, I am taking a stand against the genocide perpetrated by Israel in our country. We will do whatever it takes to free our country,” Alghoul said.
“Bodies like the UN need to do more as this is ethnic cleansing by Israel.”

According to a summary of the phone call released by Netanyahu’s office, the Israeli prime minister told Biden that “the uninvolved were evacuated” from the Gaza tower block that housed media offices as well as other offices and apartments and that were destroyed earlier in the day in an Israeli air attack.

Hundreds of Lebanese and Palestinian protesters have gathered along Lebanon’s southern border with Israel in the towns of Kfarkila and Odayseh in solidarity with Gaza and Sheikh Jarrah, Kareem Chehayeb has reported from Odayseh.
Lebanese army soldiers and UNIFIL forces were heavily deployed in the area. Some protesters threw Molotov cocktails and rocks over the border wall, only for Lebanese soldiers to quickly stop them. Some protesters even tried to scale the wall.
Israeli forces reportedly shot one protester trying to climb over the wall, local media reported. Israeli forces on the other side of the barrier were deployed at a distance, with a reconnaissance drone above them.
Israeli forces have injured at least 29 Palestinians by Israeli forces in different areas of the occupied West Bank during Nakba Day, which marks the forced expulsion of nearly 800,000 Palestinians to make way for the establishment of Israel in 1948.
According to the Palestine Red Crescent Society, 17 of the injured people had been shot with live bullets and eight with rubber-coated bullets. Three more people needed medical attention after inhaling tear gas.
At least 15 Palestinians have been killed and hundreds more injured by Israeli forces across the occupied West Bank including in Hebron, Ramallah and the northern cities of Nablus and Qalqilya.

Mariam Barghouti, a Palestinian writer based in Ramallah told Al Jazeera, that on May 15, which marks 73 years since the Nakba, there are feelings of frustration, anger, but of hope as well for Palestinians.
“Right now, a lot of the feeling is that we are at a final breath, and this is the time to change,” Barghouti said.
“Anger is an emotion that is very natural when you’re being oppressed, and you’re being beaten. When you are getting messages from the 19- and 20-year-olds in Gaza saying we’re just sitting like ducks waiting to be killed.
“We are angry because we have hope. We are angry because we see a different reality. The opposite of that would be apathy, would be submission. It would be becoming what Israel has tried to do with Palestinians and that is pacify us,” Barghouti said.

Al Jazeera’s Safwat al-Kahlout reporting from Gaza City said that for the first time in six days since the offensive started, Israelis have targeted and hit the house of senior Hamas political leader Khalil al-Hayya in east Gaza City.
Palestinian groups have responded by firing rockets towards Beer Sheva, al-Kahlout said.

“This is the third attack on a tower which houses various media, on top of that we’ve recorded 30 incidents of journalists being beaten or being detained,” Dear said.

Aidan White of the Ethical Journalism Network told Al Jazeera that the images of media buildings being destroyed are “disgraceful and worst of all reckless.
“The threat to civilian life is completely unacceptable. I think it once again highlights perilous risks facing journalists and media in conflict zones,” White said.
“It seems to me a catastrophic attempt to shut down media, to silence criticism. Worst of all, create a cloak of secrecy around this conflict.
“When the bullets start flying, when the shells start dropping, unfortunately, it’s often media that are targeted by one side or another. Unfortunately, Israel, in this regard, has a history of being prepared to target media they would prefer to silence.”

“It’s the safest place as we know. Shifa has been targeted before but obviously, it’s a hospital so it might be the safest place now in Gaza from where we will be broadcasting,” al-Sayed said.

“The destruction is massive. Hundreds of families now have evacuated the building and the building next to it, and the buildings opposite to it, which means … more families have been added to the list of thousands of families who have been displaced in the Gaza Strip right now. No place in Gaza now seems safe.”

She added: “It’s heartbreaking that the Palestinians in Gaza have only these two choices while they don’t actually have shelters to protect them.”
Basher continued: “Yesterday, it was a difficult night. We slept at 4am and my kids kept waking up. My husband and I took a very long time to calm them down. It’s terrifying, it’s traumatising. I don’t want my kids to live like this, I want my kids to live in peace and I want the whole world to hear their screams, that’s why I tweeted, that’s why I’m writing.

Tamara Alrifai, director of strategic communications and spokeswoman at the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), said the agency was “extremely shocked and devastated” at the news of the bombardment of the Shati refugee camp.
“We are extremely distressed about that development, just like we are distressed about the entire situation in Gaza and actually the entire situation of the occupied Palestinian territory,” she told Al Jazeera.
“What’s happening in Gaza cannot be disassociated with what’s happening in the West Bank, the protests and the indiscriminate use of force by the Israeli security forces that were the trigger for the events in Gaza and for what is now a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza”.
Israel has said its forces are not targeting civilians, but that Hamas fighters have been hiding among them. Alrifai rejected that Hamas members have been sheltering in UN refugee camps and facilities such as Shati camp.
“This is total disinformation, that Hamas [is] hiding in UN camps and that being the reason for striking either extremely densely populated refugee camps or causing excessive damage to the UNRWA headquarters, like what happened two days ago,” Alrifai said.
