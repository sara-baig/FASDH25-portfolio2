Is international law respected in the Israel-Palestine conflict?

-----

At least 200 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli air raids on Gaza since last week.
Residential buildings and homes have been destroyed and water supplies are running out.
Ten people in Israel have been killed in the past week.
Israel says it is targeting tunnels and military facilities in self-defence following rocket attacks by Palestinian factions.
But, according to the UN, the right to self-defence belongs to people living under occupation.
Hamas says its actions were in response to Israel’s policy of the forced displacement of Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem and the storming of Al-Aqsa Mosque by Israeli forces last week.
That spread into fighting between mixed communities of Jewish and Palestinian-Israelis.
The UN is warning the fighting could unleash uncontainable security and humanitarian crisis.
International calls for a ceasefire have been mounting.
Where does that leave the Palestinians fighting for their rights?
