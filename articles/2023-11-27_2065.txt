Three Palestinian students aged 20 shot in Vermont, US: What to know

-----

Three young Palestinian men have been shot near a university campus in Vermont in the US weeks after a six-year-old Palestinian-American boy was stabbed to death, raising alarms against rising Islamophobia in the country.
Critics say the media coverage and the political discourse in the US have caused anti-Arab and anti-Islam sentiment to rise amid Israel’s war on Gaza which has killed nearly 15,000 Palestinians.
