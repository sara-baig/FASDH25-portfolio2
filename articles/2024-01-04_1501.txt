Will Iran retaliate after the deadly bombings in Kerman?

-----

More than 80 people were killed in the southeastern Iranian city of Kerman when two explosions went off during a crowded procession on Wednesday.
The attack happened during a ceremony marking four years since the United States assassinated one of Iran’s top generals, Qassem Soleimani.
The attack has added yet another layer of tension in a region already embroiled in Israel’s war on Gaza, and this week’s assassination of a Hamas commander in Lebanon.
So, is there a connection? And will the suspicions of different governments and armed groups escalate the violence?
