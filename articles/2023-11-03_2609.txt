Should Palestinians, Israelis live equally in one state?

-----

Israeli-American peace activist Miko Peled has been advocating anti-Zionism for decades, arguing that Western governments who back Israel “are supporting the fight against justice, the fight against peace”.
As US officials stress the need for a two-state solution, Peled tells host Steve Clemons that a serious peace between Palestinians and Israelis can only be achieved if all of them – followers of Judaism, Christianity and Islam – live as equals and share the country.
The biggest problem facing the Palestinians, according to Peled, is that they are “political orphans” – they have no regional power defending their rights and aspirations.
