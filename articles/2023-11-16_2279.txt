Critics reject Israeli claim al-Shifa Hospital used as Hamas command centre

-----

Israeli forces have raided the al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City for the second consecutive day, following days of encircling the largest medical facility in Gaza.
They claim to have found what they call “grab bags” containing weapons and uniforms belonging to Hamas fighters.
But many observers have questioned what Israeli forces presented as evidence.
And there are fears that with the Israeli military in sole control of the operation, it could fabricate evidence to bolster its allegations.
Several experts have also argued that attacking hospitals – especially those treating critically ill patients and babies – could be a war crime as defined under international law.
