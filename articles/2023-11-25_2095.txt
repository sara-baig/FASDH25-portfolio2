Finnish FM: Finland’s defence deal with Israel vs its stance on Gaza

-----

As the easternmost European Union member, Finland, historically neutral, pivots towards NATO in response to Russia’s Ukraine invasion, new geopolitical challenges arise: increased Russian espionage, cyberattacks and potential election interference, the Finnish government says.
Additionally, a surge of asylum seekers, allegedly directed by Russia, strains stability.
Amid these tensions, Finland’s $345m Israeli defence deal, which many see as conflicting with its stance on Gaza, sparks debate.
Discussing these complex issues, Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen talks to Al Jazeera.
