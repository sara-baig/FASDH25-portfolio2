Who are the Lions’ Den armed group in the occupied West Bank?

-----

An armed group has emerged out of Nablus, in the northern occupied West Bank, in the past few months, and appears to be changing the face of Palestinian resistance.
The Lions’ Den has gained notoriety for attacks against Israeli checkpoints, soldiers and settlements.
Israel has attempted to crush the group, as well as others, in an operation code-named “Break the Wave”, leading to near-daily raids and dozens of Palestinians killed.
But so far, the group has remained active, with few signs that the occupied Palestinian territory will be pacified any time soon.
