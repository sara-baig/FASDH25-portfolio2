Photos: Protests in Palestine after the death of Khader Adnan

-----

A high-profile Palestinian prisoner has died in Israeli custody after being on a hunger strike for 86 days to protest his detention without charge or trial.
Khader Adnan died on Tuesday at a time of already soaring tensions between Israel and the Palestinians.
The 45-year-old Adnan was a leading member of the armed group Islamic Jihad. He began staging protracted hunger strikes more than a decade ago, introducing a new form of protest into the Palestinian struggle against Israelâ€™s occupation.
Rights groups said Israeli authorities ignored recent warnings that his life was in danger. The Israeli prison services said Adnan had refused medical treatment.
