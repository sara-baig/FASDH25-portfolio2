Is the Palestinian Authority still relevant?

-----

Amid mounting pressure from the United States, the Palestinian Authority is shaking up its leadership.
President Mahmoud Abbas has named his financial adviser as the new prime minister.
Sixty-nine-year-old Mohammed Mustafa has ample experience in economics, but little in politics.
The move has surprised many – violence is escalating in the occupied West Bank and Israel’s war on Gaza shows no sign of ending.
So, how could this appointment shape the future of the PA?
And does it have enough backing from Palestinians to move forward?
