Riyad al-Maliki: Is the Palestinian Authority still relevant?

-----

The latest Israeli offensive in Gaza that started May 11 is considered the worst since the 2014 Gaza War.
Israelâ€™s security cabinet and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire 11 days later.
But how long will the truce last?
And while the Israeli offensive seems to have brought the Palestinian people together, it is not clear if it also brought unification among the leaders of the Palestinian factions.
As some question if the Palestinian Authority is still relevant, what role did it actually play in the agreement?
The Palestinian Foreign Minister, Riyad al-Maliki, talks to Al Jazeera.
