Even in a time of genocide, Big Tech silences Palestinians, writes Marwa Fatafta. To find out why she believes so, read this opinion piece.
We will soon be closing this live page. Here’s a recap of the day’s developments:
The Palestinian Prisoners’ Club says Israel has arrested more than 100 Palestinians in Jenin and the Jenin refugee camp since Tuesday morning.
Israeli forces have been carrying out an extensive raid in the area in the north of the occupied West Bank.
“This is unequivocally one of the biggest and longest raids that we’ve seen since the beginning of the war on October 7,” Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford reported from Ramallah.
“No indications so far that this raid is anywhere near ending.”
We’ll bring you more updates on the situation when we can.
The Icelandic Society of Authors and Composers issued a statement with the demand, saying that Iceland should withdraw from the European song competition if Israel is allowed to participate.
The society’s board said that Israel should be banned on the same grounds that Russia had been after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
“We all have a duty to take a stand against war and the killing of civilians and innocent children,” the board said, quoted by The Reykjavik Grapevine. “We owe it to those nations that act with force through military might not to share the stage in an event that is always characterised by joy and optimism.”
In 2019, the Icelandic entry to Eurovision displayed the Palestinian flag during the show, in support of the Palestinian people.
Biden has announced that his defence chief and national security adviser are heading to the region to discuss the situation in Gaza.
Biden did not specify which countries US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin will visit during his trip.
Jake Sullivan, the White House’s national security adviser, will visit Israel and meet with the country’s war cabinet to discuss the US commitment to Israel as well as the need to protect civilians in Gaza, Biden said.
The US president’s remarks come despite outrage and accusations of anti-Semitism over similar comments he made on Monday.
“I believe, without Israel as a freestanding state, not a Jew in the world is safe – not a Jew in the world is safe,” Biden told donors at a campaign reception.
A variation of those remarks had sparked anger against the president, with many noting that the safety and security of Jewish Americans is the responsibility of the US government, not a foreign country.
IfNotNow, a progressive Jewish group, had called on Biden to apologise.
“As President of the United States, it’s his job to make this country safe for everyone, including Jewish Americans,” Eva Borgwardt, the group’s national spokesperson, said in a statement earlier on Tuesday.
We are deeply offended by President Biden’s statement last night, and call on him to apologize.
Telling American Jews that our safety ultimately comes from Israel is antisemitic. Like all other Americans, like all other humans, we deserve to be safe & free in the place we live. https://t.co/eKfMEIc3Aj

The military said that aircraft and tanks attacked Syrian army positions inside Syria after three missiles were earlier fired from Syria towards the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
The Israeli military said that only one of the rockets hit the Golan Heights, which is Syrian territory that Israel has unilaterally annexed.
It added that Israeli forces also attacked a Hezbollah rocket launcher position in Lebanese territory.
Riyad Mansour said protests across the world calling for a ceasefire, including demonstrations outside the UN headquarters, must be heard.
He added that the “massive power” of protests culminated in the UNGA resolution, which was overwhelmingly approved earlier, stressing that Washington cannot overlook the will of billions of people across the world.
“We hope in a few days – inshallah [God willing] few hours – that the United States [will] come to the conclusion to force Israel to stop this aggression against our people,” Mansour told reporters.
Mark Leon Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of the UN Dispatch, said the UNGA vote showed that momentum has been building, with more countries now supporting a ceasefire in Gaza.
“It’s just worth emphasising how overwhelming this vote was in favour of a humanitarian ceasefire,” Goldberg told Al Jazeera.
However, Goldberg added that the momentum won’t necessarily translate to the Security Council, where the US has vetoed attempts to push through what would be a binding resolution for a ceasefire, unlike the UNGA’s non-binding resolution.
“I suspect what we’ll see is further momentum building for further creative ways to impress upon the United States, in particular, the need for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire,” Goldberg said. “It’s going to get increasingly difficult for the United States to pursue its other priorities at the United Nations while remaining so isolated on this issue.”
He added that while there is increasing public criticism from the US administration, and Biden himself, towards Israel’s actions, it remains to be seen whether that will translate into support for a ceasefire.
“Until the United States supports a ceasefire, a ceasefire resolution will not pass the Security Council and the US will remain deeply isolated at the General Assembly,” Goldberg added.
Cargo ships and other vessels have been warned by Yemen’s Houthi rebels against “falsifying their identities” or turning off their radio signal as they navigate the Red Sea.
In a statement posted on social media, Mohamed Ali al-Houthi, the head of Yemen’s Houthi supreme revolutionary committee, wrote that any vessels navigating through the Red Sea are not allowed to travel towards Israel.
He also said that those vessels must quickly respond to Houthi attempts at communication.
Al-Houthi also reiterated Houthi opposition to the US and Israeli “aggression” against Gaza, while vowing to break the siege of the enclave.
The Iran-allied Houthis have conducted several attacks targeting Israel since October as well as taking control of a ship traveling near Yemen after they claimed it was linked to Israel. Then, on Monday, the Houthis hit a Norwegian tanker moving through the Red Sea with a missile.
The vote saw some key Washington allies back the call for ending the war, with only eight countries siding with the US and Israel against the non-binding resolution.
UN Security Council members France – a close US partner – China and Russia backed the measure, as the UK abstained.
Ukraine, which has been receiving US military and financial support against the Russian invasion, also abstained. So did Germany, which staunchly supports Israel, while neighbouring Austria joined Israel in voting against the measure.
Poland, a NATO member and US ally that borders Ukraine, voted for the resolution along with the northern European countries of Finland and Sweden.
Some US partners in the vital Asia-Pacific region also backed the call for the ceasefire, including India, Japan and South Korea. Australia voted in favour as well.
Moreover, the US’s neighbours to the north and the south – Canada and Mexico –  sided with the majority in support of a ceasefire.
“The world has witnessed a strong, noble and great stance by the General Assembly,” Riyad Mansour said.
Mansour stressed that the resolution “demands” a ceasefire, which he said carries an authoritative tone. “This holds additional power,” he added, speaking in Arabic as he explained that the measure did not just “call for” an end to the fighting.
Mansour noted that more than 30 additional nations have backed today’s resolution compared with the first UNGA ceasefire call in October, which received 120 votes.
“We hope and we will work to ensure that the Israeli authority will abide by this humanitarian ceasefire immediately – as the UN chief has demanded, as 13 countries in the Security Council have demanded, and as the General Assembly has demanded moments ago,” he said. “Our efforts will continue.”
Salman Shaikh, the policy adviser at The Shaikh Group, says the overwhelming UNGA vote highlights that the UN “wanted to send a clear message at this moment in time”.
Shaikh told Al Jazeera that he believes the US knows the war has to come to an end and “this vote should shorten that timeframe”.
“What would be a helpful start is to go back to negotiations, to release those hostages and prisoners,” he said.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says he discussed the “dire situation” in Gaza during a meeting with the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and the Palestinian Authority, as well as the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation secretary general.
In a brief statement posted on X, the WHO chief said the UN health agency “will continue to support civilians and health personnel in any possible way”.
“But we need sustained, safe, scaled up access to do this. And this is only possible via a ceasefire,” he said.
I just met with Foreign Ministers @FaisalbinFarhan, @Menlu_RI and Riad Malki, and Hissein Brahim Taha, @OIC_OCI Secretary-General, to discuss the dire health situation in #Gaza. We discussed our shared concerns over the systematic degradation of the health system.@WHO will… pic.twitter.com/igGIZYjHFN

Unsurprisingly, Israel and the US were among the countries to vote against the motion.
Also among them were two tiny Pacific Islands – Micronesia and Nauru – with a combined population of fewer than 130,000 people.
Here is the list:
Salman Shaikh, a policy adviser at The Shaikh Group, says the UN has reached this point because it is “failing to maintain international peace and security”.
“What we’re seeing is the continuing failure of the UN and that goes back to one particular country … the United States,” he told Al Jazeera.
The US, he said, is continuing to provide “diplomatic cover” for Israel amid what Shaikh described as a “global movement” urging a humanitarian ceasefire.
“We’ve reached a point as we’ve heard from UN officials, that you can’t do that humanitarian work any more,” Shaikh said. “Even if hundreds of aid trucks come in … they can’t actually get around.”
The resolution passed in a vote of:
This time, there are 84 votes in favour, with 62 against and 25 abstentions. The UNGA will now move forward and vote on the draft resolution introduced by Egypt, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.
89 members voted in favour of the Austrian amendment at the UNGA but this fails to meet the required two-thirds majority.
61 member states voted against, with 20 abstentions.
Mathu Joyini, South Africa’s envoy to the UN, has called for universally applying international law.
“The events of the past six weeks in Gaza have illustrated that Israel is acting contrary to its obligation in terms of the Genocide Convention,” Joyini said, referring to the international treaty that outlaws genocide.
“As a UN member state and owing to South Africa’s painful past experience of a system of apartheid, this impresses on us as member states to take action in accordance with international law.”
Gilad Erdan has called the resolution “hypocritical”, saying that ending the war would only benefit Hamas.
“Why would anyone want to aid Hamas in continuing the rule of terror and actualising their satanic agenda?” the Israeli UN envoy said.
Pakistani envoy Munir Akram criticised a proposed amendment to the General Assembly resolution, which he said would “condemn only one side but exonerate the other”.
“For Austria and my friend from the United States to blame Hamas in their amendments is not equitable, is not just,” Akram said. “The blame – if it’s to be placed – has to be placed on both parties, especially on Israel.”
He went on to dismiss the argument that Israeli attacks on Gaza are in self-defence.
“This is a war against the Palestinian people. Israel’s goal is to erase not only a people but the entire idea of Palestine. Its campaign is a carbon copy of the massive campaigns of racial slaughter by other settler colonial regimes in history.”
Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), says the destruction of the UN-run school is “outrageous”.
As we reported earlier, Israeli forces blew up an UNRWA school in Beit Hanoon.
Public facilities, including hospitals and UN-run schools, are protected under international law, Lazzarini wrote in a post on X.
“Parties to this brutal war have the coordinates of all our facilities in Gaza,” he added.
Saw videos of an @UNRWA school in northern #Gaza blown up. It is outrageous. All public facilities, including hospitals & @UN schools are protected under international law. Parties to this brutal war have the coordinates of all our facilities in Gaza.

Francesca Albanese says it is “absolutely shocking” that the Swiss government is taking such a step at “such a critical time”.
“Hope the Swiss senate will not let it pass,” she wrote on X.
A number of Western countries are cutting aid to human rights NGOs in occupied Palestinian territory and Israel.
The Swiss gvt, top of the list, is also cutting aid to UNRWA. At such a critical time, this is absolutely shocking.
Hope the Swiss senate will not let it pass. https://t.co/Tf981FHZPz
