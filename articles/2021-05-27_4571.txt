Is there hope for revived peace talks on Palestine, Israel?

-----

Almost 30 years ago, a Norwegian power couple decided to bring together Palestinian and Israeli officials in Oslo with the aim of reaching a peace treaty. This led to a historic deal signed by the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel at the White House in 1993.
Host Steve Clemons speaks with Bartlett Sher, the director of Oslo, a new HBO drama telling the story of the secret talks.
And former Palestinian negotiations adviser Diana Buttu and former Israeli adviser Daniel Levy explain that as long as the ongoing occupation of Palestinian lands comes at “no cost,” the future for both sides is bleak.
