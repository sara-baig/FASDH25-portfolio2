Netanyahu ‘determined’ to continue Gaza bombardment

-----

Israeli fighter jets continued to pummel the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, flattening residential buildings and raising the death toll to at least 227.
The health ministry of Gaza said the dead included 64 children and 38 women.
On the 10th day of the escalating violence, US President Joe Biden discussed the Gaza events with Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying he expected “a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire”.
However, Netanyahu said after the phone call with Biden that he was “determined” to continue bombarding Gaza until Israel’s “aim is met”.
Meanwhile, diplomatic efforts for a ceasefire between Israel and Gaza’s Hamas government have failed to make much headway.
The United States continued to block the UN Security Council from issuing a joint statement urging an end to the hostilities, telling diplomats that a public statement would not help calm the tensions.
France, however, says it is working with Israel’s neighbours, Egypt and Jordan, on a new ceasefire resolution. China said it was “supportive” of the French proposal.
Here are Wednesday’s developments – as they happened:

South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa said in an interview with television outlet France 24 that the Israeli treatment of Palestinians resembles apartheid-era South Africa.
“Palestinians want their own self-determination rights. They want their own state. They want to be able to run their own affairs and have freedom, and not have to be restricted to move around,” Ramaphosa said.
The way the Israelis “have been denying the Palestinians their rights, the way they’ve been bombing the area, one could quite easily characterise it as an apartheid-type of state”, he said.
“I have no other reference point to describe what the Israelis are doing against the Palestinians,” the South African leader said.

Palestinian human rights group Al-Haq is calling for an international investigation into Israeli attack in Gaza, including on journalists and media organisations.
The group pointed to the destruction of al-Jalaa tower, which housed the offices of Al Jazeera and The Associated Press, among other attacks, as “unlawful”.
UN member states must “condemn Israel’s unwarranted targeting of media buildings”, Al-Haq said, and “pressure Israel to urgently and immediately treat media personnel and media buildings as protected civilians and civilian objects, and respect their humanitarian immunity”.
"The targeting of media offices, whether directly or as collateral damage, cannot be distinguished from a willingness to silence opposition media & voices expressing against IOF’s crimes committed against civilian population in the Gaza Strip" #GazaUnderAttack #SaveSheikhJarrah https://t.co/TqAqOt0vZR

“In more than a decade of his right-wing rule in Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu has cultivated an increasingly intolerant and authoritarian type of racist nationalism,” said Senator Bernie Sanders in Senate floor remarks.
At the same time, Sanders condemned the Palestinian group Hamas as a “corrupt” and “repressive” organisation.
“We must stand in solidarity with those Palestinians and Israelis working to build a future of peaceful co-existence and not with those who would destroy it,” said Sanders, who called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.
19 May 2021 - 21:35 GMT
US-based political analyst Omar Baddar says the Israeli government has a “long history … [of] being resistant to any possibility of American pressure to change their behaviour”.
“Ultimately, the Biden administration has come under pressure to merely rhetorically demand that Israel de-escalate, but the United States military funding of Israel continues completely untouched,” Baddar told Al Jazeera.
“I think the Israeli leadership understands that this is ultimately a bluff – that there is not going to be action put where there are only words – and therefore they are completely free to carry on with their massive assault against Gaza’s civilian population.”
19 May 2021 - 21:31 GMT
A special session of the UN General Assembly will be held on Thursday to discuss the continuing violence in Gaza, Al Jazeera’s Kristen Saloomey reported from New York.
The meeting comes amid failed efforts by the UN Security Council to agree to a statement calling for a ceasefire due to US opposition.

19 May 2021 - 21:21 GMT
Al Jazeera’s Safwat al-Kahlout said “more selective” Israeli air raids had been conducted in central and south Gaza late on Wednesday.
Some houses in those areas were directly targeted, al-Kahlout said, but far fewer Israeli attacks had been carried out over the past hour compared with the same time the day before.
Rocketfire from Gaza towards Israel also reduced significantly compared with previous days, al-Kahlout said.

More than 2,000 people turned out at a rally in Berlin under the banner “Against Israeli aggression in Palestine,” a police spokesperson said.
Many people waved Palestinian flags. The demonstration was peaceful, according to initial reports.
However, it was called off before the procession had reached the city’s Brandenburg Gate, and the police spokesperson was initially unable to explain the reasons it ended sooner than planned.



19 May 2021 - 19:02 GMT
Hundreds of Kuwaitis demonstrated in support of Palestinians and burned an Israeli flag to protest at the bombardment of Gaza after authorities allowed the rally to proceed despite coronavirus restrictions.
Protesters, who were only granted access to a main square on foot to limit numbers, chanted “Death to Israel” and held banners rejecting normalisation accords struck by the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to forge ties with Israel.
“We send a message to our friends in GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries that any normalisation with the Zionists will not help. It helps the killer against the Palestinian people,” said 43-year-old Osama al-Zaid, a Kuwaiti political activist.
“Palestine and Al-Aqsa are in our hearts. We absolutely refuse it (normalisation),” said 30-year-old Kuwaiti employee Zahraa Habeeb.
Other protesters, who included dozens of expatriates, chanted slogans calling for rocket attacks on Tel Aviv.
19 May 2021 - 18:42 GMT
In response to Biden’s de-escalation call, Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassam said those who sought to restore calm must “compel Israel to end its aggression in Jerusalem and its bombardment of Gaza”.
Once that happened, Qassam said, “there can be room to talk about arrangements to restore calm.”
The leader of Islamic Jihad, another Gaza group, said political talks “remain at a standstill”.
“The only path towards freedom [is] to protect Jerusalem and people,” said Islamic Jihad chief Ziad al-Nakhala.

Pakistanis marched in the streets of Karachi to protest the Israeli air raids on Gaza.
“I think we all need to come together as humans, we all need to come together as Muslims to help Palestine gain its freedom. Enough is enough,” said one protester, civil society activist Lubna Lakhani.
“Palestine has suffered for years and years and years. This really needs to stop, and I am doing my very little bit to help that cause. And I am praying every single night for them. Free Palestine.”
19 May 2021 - 17:29 GMT
A small group of US progressive legislators led by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are objecting to a $735m US munitions sale to Israel approved by the Biden administration.
“For decades, the US has sold billions of dollars in weaponry to Israel without ever requiring them to respect basic Palestinian rights,” Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement on Wednesday.
“In so doing, we have directly contributed to the death, displacement and disenfranchisement of millions,” she said.
The United States should not be rubber-stamping weapons sales to the Israeli government as they deploy our resources to target international media outlets, schools, hospitals, humanitarian missions and civilian sites for bombing.

UN aid convoy still being held up at Gaza-Israel border
Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan, reporting from southern Israel, said the UN aid convoy was still being held up at the Karam Abu Salim border crossing (Kerem Shalom in Hebrew), more than 24 hours after Israel re-shut the border into Gaza that it briefly opened for aid deliveries.
“The UN is frustrated with the Israelis. The Israelis are simply not opening the border because they say the barrier isn’t secure and they can’t secure that convoy into the Gaza Strip,” he said.
“Once again, it’s one of these things [that is] incredibly frustrating on all sides. If there was a breakthrough, people would perhaps be talking louder about a ceasefire, some potential cessation of hostilities but that no longer seems to be something that’s being talked about.”
“In fact, we’ve heard very hard words from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who is saying effectively all options are on the table including the reoccupation of Gaza and that’s not something most people in Israel are taking seriously.”
“It just goes to show the kind of language and mood the Israelis are in and that’s why that aid, 24 hours later, is still stuck at that barrier crossing.”
19 May 2021 - 15:56 GMT
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that he is “determined to continue this operation until its aim is met”, despite US President Joe Biden’s call for a de-escalation of hostilities in Gaza.

Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett, reporting from Washington DC, said US President Joe Biden’s phone call to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was “really important” even though he didn’t call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.
“Instead, the read out says they had a detailed discussion about the state of events in Gaza. Still, what we can see in diplomatic speak is an incremental step forward,” she said.
“Earlier in the week, the US president was insisting that there was support for a ceasefire, so we’ve now gone a step further but there still is not this outright call for one,” Halkett added.
“What the White House has been doing in this time is insisting that quiet diplomacy is taking place, that telephone diplomacy is taking place and there is diplomacy going on with some of its partners and allies, namely Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, who have channels to Hamas and this is the way the US believes they can bring down the escalation.”



19 May 2021 - 15:19 GMT
Mazen Naim, communications officer for Save the Children in Gaza, told Al Jazeera that the continuing Israeli air raids were preventing international organisations from delivering aid and assessing the damages in Gaza.
“We draw up plans and wait until the ceasefire happens so we are able to reach people and deliver the assistance and do the assessment of the schools,” he said.
“The first step is to do an assessment of the damage and raise funds for the rebuilding and rehabilitation for the schools, everything that’s related to the physical side in order to resume education which is going to be expensive, exhausting and will take a lot of effort from international donors and aid organisation here on the ground.”
“But there is also the psychological part, the children themselves will be suffering from trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder and various other disorders,” he said.

He said Iran has been outspoken in its defence of the Palestinians and the condemnation of Israel.
“We’ve seen placards here and chants, the traditional chants of death to Israel and death to the United States. Iran hasn’t hidden the fact that they support the Palestinians in terms of technology and know-how when it comes to those rockets and drones.”
