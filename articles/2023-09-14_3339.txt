The Oslo peace accords: Historic achievement or historic tragedy?

-----

The peace treaty signed by Palestinian and Israeli leaders on 13 September 1993 was a game-changer.
The Oslo Accords, brokered by Norwegian diplomats, were supposed to be a five-year plan. Palestinians achieved some degree of self-rule in disjointed parts of their historic homeland in return for recognising Israel as a legitimate state.
Three decades later, the Oslo plan still governs the relationship between the Palestinians and the Israelis â€“ but a lasting peaceful relationship between the two sides is as unattainable as ever.
Host Steve Clemons asks Palestinian politician Mustafa Barghouti and Israeli politician Yossi Beilin about what went wrong.
