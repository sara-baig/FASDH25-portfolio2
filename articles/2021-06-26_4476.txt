Sliman Mansour: The art of the Palestinian resistance

-----

Born in 1947, in Birzeit, Palestine, a year before the establishment of the State of Israel, Sliman Mansour studied fine arts in Jerusalem.
Growing up under occupation, his work first gained recognition when he was aged 26, with the piece “Camel of Hardship”, which portrays an elderly, bent-over porter struggling to carry the city of Jerusalem on his back. And ever since, his work depicting the Palestinian struggle and culture has travelled the world.
Now, at 75, has he lost hope that peace will ever come? Sliman Mansour talks to Al Jazeera.
