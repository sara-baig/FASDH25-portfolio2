World reaction to surprise attack by Palestinian Hamas on Israel

-----

The Palestinian group Hamas has launched the biggest attack on Israel in years with many killed, hostages taken, and fighting raging after a surprise assault that included gunmen entering Israeli towns after a barrage of rockets fired from the Gaza Strip.

“Belgium strongly condemns the massive rocket attacks against Israeli civilians. Violence and terror only perpetuates suffering and hinders the path to dialogue. Our thoughts are with all those affected. We are monitoring the situation closely,” Foreign Affairs Minister Hadja Lahbib wrote on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.
