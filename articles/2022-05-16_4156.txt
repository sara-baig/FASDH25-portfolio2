The life and legacy of Shireen Abu Akleh

-----


For decades, the Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was a mainstay on the TV screens of Arabic-speaking households around the world. Shireen worked for Al Jazeera for 26 years, as one of the networkâ€™s first field reporters. And she was a pioneer â€“ she set a path for women journalists in Arab media. She was killed by Israeli forces on May 11, and in the days since, thereâ€™s been an outpouring of grief. In this episode, we hear from people who loved Shireen about her life and legacy.
