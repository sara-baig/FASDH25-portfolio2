Is Israel committing genocide in Gaza?

-----

Israel’s war on Gaza has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and forced most others from their homes.
Now, it is going to have to answer to charges of genocide in a court of law.
South Africa is launching a case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) – the United Nations’ highest legal body.
While a final ruling could be years away, the ICJ could make a provisional order for Israel to end its campaign in a matter of weeks.
So how significant would that be? And will it help bring an end to the conflict?
