Is Israel in breach of the ruling by the International Court of Justice?

-----

The United Nations’ top court has ordered Israel to prevent and punish actions that could lead to or incite genocide in Gaza.
But in the weeks that followed this ruling, Israeli forces have continued the devastating assault on Gaza.
Now Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is threatening a possible ground offensive in Rafah, where more than half of Gaza’s population has fled to seek shelter. Palestinians are trapped, with nowhere to go.
So, what can be done to end the Israeli assault?
