No medicines, water, food scarcity: All to know about Gaza after Israel war

-----

The Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip has turned a large part of the besieged Palestinian enclave into a pile of rubble, with people in desperate need of water and other basic necessities amid a total blockade of the enclave.
People have been forced to dig wells near the sea to fetch water as Gaza – home to 2.3 million people – is facing a shortage of water as well as food. Generators are powering hospitals after Israel cut electricity following the Hamas attack that killed 1,400 Israelis. The hospitals have few hours of fuel left.
“Food is running out, warehouses are all empty. In the few supermarkets that are open, most of the shelves are bare. There is also a shortage of water,” said Al Jazeera’s Safwat Kahlout from Gaza.
Here’s what’s to know about the current struggle for medical care, food and water in Gaza:
The shelves are emptying. (Again, I refuse to hoard). The guy said he put almost all his stocks on the shelves. Not sure how long this will last in a very crowded area that has several UN schools sheltering people who are “abandoned” by the UN. #Gazagenocide #gazaunderattack pic.twitter.com/sfLBBbx2m8

This was my meal for breakfast. The kids had double the amount. The little food from the remaining shops is running out (I have money to buy but don’t want to hoard.).
Water is strictly rationed. Food is rationed. Cooking gas is rationed. We are taking far fewer showers. https://t.co/0BPndmgw6K pic.twitter.com/Pewq70HJ2e
