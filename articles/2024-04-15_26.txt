Will Israel respond to Iran’s first-ever direct attack?

-----

The smoke has cleared and the dust has settled after Iran’s unprecedented attack on Israel.
The weekend attack – the first direct military action targeting Israel from Iranian soil – was, says Iran, proportional retaliation for the bombing of its consulate in Syria.
Israeli leaders have vowed to respond.
Fears are growing of an escalation into a regional war.
Are those fears justified?
And what would a direct confrontation between the regional rivals mean for an already volatile Middle East?
