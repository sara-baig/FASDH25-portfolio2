Eleven Days in May

-----

In 2021, in the 11 days between May 10 and 21, Israel’s bombardment of Gaza killed more than 60 Palestinian children.
This film is a stark, emotional memorial to some of these children, told through family testimony, home footage and images of young lives, lived and lost.
In a grim and repeating pattern, day by day, family by family, their stories unfold: brothers and sisters laugh and cry as they recall shared childhoods; grieving parents relive painful details of the bombings and create memorial tableaus of their children’s possessions; cousins, aunts and neighbours paint a picture of childhood and family life in Gaza.
On some days, entire families were all but wiped out. In a single strike, a man lost his wife and three children, all aged under 10. Another attack killed four siblings from the al-Hadidi family – the eldest, Yousef, was 11 years old. The families address the viewer directly. They share the joys of life before and the pain of funerals after, in a simple yet powerful narrative of 11 devastating days in Gaza.
