What are the legal consequences of Israel’s occupation?

-----

The United Nations General Assembly has passed a resolution calling on the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to give an opinion on the legal consequences of Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory.
The last time the ICJ gave an opinion on the conflict between Israelis and the Palestinians was in 2004, when it ruled Israel’s separation wall was illegal.
The top UN court deals with disputes between states.
And although its rulings are binding, the court itself has no power to enforce them.
So, will it change anything on the ground?
