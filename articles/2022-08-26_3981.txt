Khalil Awawdeh: Palestinian who was on a 172-day hunger strike

-----

Palestinian prisoner Khalil Awawdeh ended his 172-day hunger strike on Wednesday, after obtaining a written agreement from Israel that it will not renew his detention in October.
The 40-year-old Awawdeh began his hunger strike last March protesting his administrative detention – a process where a prisoner is held by Israel without trial or charge and is subject to indefinite renewal – since his arrest in December 2021.
Awawdeh’s case was thrust into the spotlight during Israel’s recent bombardment of the blockaded Gaza Strip.
