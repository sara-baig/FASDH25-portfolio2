The Take: What media outlets get wrong on Israel and Palestine

-----


As the war on Gaza rages, we’re looking at how the media covers it, in conversation with three people in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, all with media experience in those countries. We discuss the struggles they’ve faced when it comes to accurate information and narratives on Palestine and Israel, and what has and has not changed in this latest escalation of violence.
