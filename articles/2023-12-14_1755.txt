How much environmental damage is Israel’s war on Gaza causing?

-----

Palestinians continue to suffer in Israel’s brutal assault on Gaza – thousands killed and tens of thousands of others wounded.
One of the most intense bombing campaigns since World War II will leave not just a legacy of grief for Gaza’s people, but one of lasting physical damage to the environment.
Sanitation and water treatment systems have been destroyed.
Thousands of Israeli and Western-supplied bombs pollute the air and ground.
The war is leaving a new layer of toxic chemicals in Gaza’s soil, adding to those left behind after the many wars Israel has waged before.
Can Gaza recover?
