Does Israel care about international justice?

-----

The International Court of Justice is hearing submissions on Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories.
It will consider the legal consequences of Israel’s ongoing breach of Palestinians’ right to self-determination as well as how Israeli policies impact not only the occupied areas but also other countries and the United Nations.
Advisory opinions by the UN’s top court are nonbinding, but they carry significant moral and legal authority.
When a decision is announced, will it have global implications?
