The world reacts to the killing of Al Jazeera’s Shireen Abu Akleh

-----

Calls for a full, independent and transparent investigation into the killing of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh are mounting with world leaders demanding that those responsible be held to account.
The veteran journalist, described as an “icon of Palestinian coverage”, was shot by Israeli forces while reporting in Jenin in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday.
The tragic event has sparked global outrage with the EU urging an “independent” investigation and the UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet saying she was “appalled”. “Impunity must end,” Bachelet said.
This is how the world has reacted so far:
In New York, the US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, called Abu Akleh’s death “really horrifying” and called for a transparent investigation.
She said protecting American citizens and journalists was “our highest priority.”
We must ensure journalists performing critical work amidst conflict are protected, and we call for an immediate and thorough investigation into this tragedy.

Thomas-Greenfield said Abud Akleh did “an extraordinary interview” with her in the West Bank last November. “I left there feeling extraordinary respect for her,” she said.
The UN Human Rights office urged for an “independent, transparent investigation into her killing. Impunity must end.”
The White House also called for a thorough probe.
“We are heartbroken by and strongly condemn the killing of American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh in the West Bank,” Ned Price, US State Department Spokesman, said on Twitter. “The investigation must be immediate and thorough and those responsible must be held accountable. Her death is an affront to media freedom everywhere,” he added.
Earlier in the day, the US ambassador to Israel, Tom Nides, had said on Twitter he was “very sad” to learn about the journalist’s killing and called for “a thorough investigation into the circumstances”.
Very sad to learn of the death of American and Palestinian journalist Shireen Abu Akleh of @AJArabic @AJEnglish. I encourage a thorough investigation into the circumstances of her death and the injury of at least one other journalist today in Jenin.

Luis Miguel Bueno, the EU’s spokesperson for the Middle East and North Africa, said on Twitter that he was “shocked” by the killing of Abu Akleh while she was doing her job reporting on Israeli raids in Jenin.
“We express our deepest condolences to her family and call for a swift and independent investigation to bring the perpetrators to justice,” he said.
Agnes Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General, said that the killing was “a bloody reminder of the deadly system in which Israel locks Palestinians”.
“Israel is killing Palestinians left and right with impunity,” she added.

In a statement, Al Jazeera Media Network condemned the “blatant murder” that violates “international laws and norms” and called Abu Akleh’s death a “heinous crime, through which it is intended to prevent the media from fulfilling its message”.
“We hold the Israeli government and the occupation forces responsible for the killing of the late colleague Shireen,” the statement said.
Al Jazeera called on the international community to hold the Israeli occupation forces accountable for their “intentional targeting and killing” of Abu Akleh.
The Palestinian Authority presidency condemned the killing of Abu Akleh as a “heinous crime”, saying the murder was “part of the [Israeli] occupation’s policy of targeting journalists to obscure the truth and commit crimes silently”.
The Palestinian public prosecution said authorities had started an investigation into the killing of Abu Akleh and would take the case to the international criminal court.
Qatar’s deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al-Thani offered in a post on Twitter his condolences to Abu Akleh’s family and colleagues at Al Jazeera media network.
“Such horrific crimes by the occupation against unarmed Palestinian people should not pass without those responsible being held accountable and should not be subject to double standards,” said al-Thani.
Lolwah Alkhater, Qatar’s deputy foreign minister, called the killing “state sponsored Israeli terrorism” and called for an end to “unconditional support to Israel”.

This account was contradicted by witness reports from Al Jazeera journalists, who said there were no confrontations between Palestinian fighters and the Israeli army.

“Silencing voices of those who tell stories of oppressed people is part of a deliberate strategy employed by Israel & India in Palestine & Occupied Kashmir,” he wrote on Twitter.

The Belgian foreign ministry condemned the killing of Abu Akleh.
“We offer our condolences to her loved ones and call for quick and strict investigation,” it said in a statement.
Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine director for Human Rights Watch, said the killing was part of a systematic approach by Israeli towards journalists covering the occupation.
