Israelâ€™s government and rising violence against Palestinians

-----

January 26 was one of the deadliest days for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank in years.
Israeli forces raided a refugee camp in the city of Jenin, killing at least nine people. The next day a Palestinian killed seven Israelis near a synagogue in occupied East Jerusalem.
This comes just weeks after a new hardline Israeli government was sworn in with Benjamin Netanyahu at the helm and with far-right figures occupying key cabinet positions.
So what will this mean for Palestinians?
On UpFront, Marc Lamont Hill puts that question to Diana Buttu, a Ramallah-based lawyer and former legal adviser to the Palestine Liberation Organization, and Noura Erakat, a human rights lawyer and associate professor at Rutgers University.
