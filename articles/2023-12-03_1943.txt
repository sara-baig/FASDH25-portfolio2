What are the implications of Israel’s reported use of AI in Gaza war?

-----

Israel’s war has devastated much of Gaza.
The few days of calm under a temporary ceasefire with Hamas have all but disappeared now, with Israel resuming its air strikes and shelling.
Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly warned that he wants to eliminate Hamas.
And now, the Israeli army is reportedly using new artificial intelligence (AI) technology to help it expand its potential list of targets.
So, what are the implications for civilians in Gaza? And could it lead to even more deaths?
