How should leaders respond to rising tension over Al-Aqsa Mosque?

-----

The Al-Aqsa Mosque compound is holy to Muslims, Jews and Christians.
With Ramadan, Passover and Easter taking place at the same time this year, tensions are running particularly high in occupied East Jerusalem.
On Sunday, Israeli police forcibly dispersed Palestinian worshippers who set up barricades to prevent ultra-right-wing Jewish groups from entering the compound.
The Al-Aqsa tensions come amid rising violence between Palestinians and Israelis.
Could the violence escalate? And how should Israeli and Palestinian leaders respond?
