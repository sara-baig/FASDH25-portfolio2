Reckoning with Laughter: Noam Shuster returns to Israel

-----

Can comedy help ease tensions between Israelis and Palestinians? Israeli comedian Noam Shuster thinks it is worth a shot.
Noam is a peace builder-turned-comedian whose political satire makes headlines across the Middle East.
She was about to launch her one-woman US comedy tour when the first coronavirus wave hit. She returns to Israel and soon finds herself recovering from COVID-19 in a government-assigned hotel â€“ where Palestinians and Israelis laugh together at her jokes.
But, as the pandemic sends the world into a tailspin, exposing racial and economic injustice, Noam is reminded how much work needs to be done in Israel.
