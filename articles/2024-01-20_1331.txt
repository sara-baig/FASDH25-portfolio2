Can international justice stop Israel?

-----

It has been more than three months since Israel launched its devastating war on Gaza. Nearly 25,000 Palestinians have now been killed, and tens of thousands more injured.
Many countries have rejected Israel’s actions – and South Africa has taken it to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), accusing it of committing genocide.
Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, even became the subject of criminal complaints in Switzerland.
Meanwhile, Mexico and Chile have referred Israel to the International Criminal Court (ICC).
But will any of this make a difference?
