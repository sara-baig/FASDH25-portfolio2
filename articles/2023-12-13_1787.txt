UNGA demands ceasefire in Israel’s war on Gaza: How your country voted

-----

The United Nations General Assembly has passed a nonbinding, symbolic resolution to demand an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire” in Gaza, with the United States and Israel voting against it but an overwhelming number of member states in favour of an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
A total of 153 countries voted in favour of the resolution on Tuesday, 10 countries voted against it, while 23 abstained.
Ambassadors and other diplomats burst into applause at the vote count, which showed much higher support than an October 27 Arab-sponsored resolution that called for a “humanitarian truce”. At that time, 121 countries voted in favour, 14 against, and 44 abstained – Iraq, citing technical difficulties, changed its vote to yes after the tally was recorded.
