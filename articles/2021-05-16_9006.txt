Gaza death toll nears 200 amid surge of Israeli raids

-----

Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that an end to seven days of hostilities with Gaza fighters was not imminent, despite diplomatic moves to restore calm.
Israel “wants to levy a heavy price” from Gaza’s Hamas rulers and its offensive on the Palestinian enclave would “take time”, he said in a televised address on Sunday – the deadliest day of Israeli air raids since the latest escalation in the Israel-Palestine conflict.
Earlier, the Israeli military launched intense raids on the Gaza Strip, killing at least 42 Palestinians, wounding dozens more, and flattening at least three residential buildings.
The home of Gaza’s Hamas chief, Yehya al-Sinwar, was also targeted, according to the group’s media.
At least 192 people, including 58 children and 34 women, have been killed in the Gaza Strip since the latest violence began a week ago.
Israel has reported 10 dead, including two children.
The United Nations Security Council met on Sunday to discuss the violence but failed to agree on even a joint statement of concern.
Here are Sunday’s developments as they happened:
16 May 2021 - 23:10 GMT
Israeli fighter jets carried out at least 55 air raids on Gaza early on Monday, Al Jazeera’s Safwat al-Kahlout reported.
Al-Kahlout said the targets included several military and security bases in the Palestinian territory, as well as some empty land east of Gaza City.
A four-storey building was also bombed in the centre of Gaza City, but early reports indicate the building was evacuated before the attack.
“The fire is intensifying on military bases, security bases, empty and evacuated training camps that belong to Palestinian fighting groups,” he said.
It was not immediately clear if any casualties had been reported.

During the past week, Israeli incursions into the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound and raids on the occupied East Jerusalem neighbourhood Sheikh Jarrah continued, while a brutal Israeli military offensive on the blockaded Gaza Strip has left many Palestinians dead.
But an extraordinary phenomenon has also taken root inside Israel, where thousands of Palestinian citizens in towns, villages and so-called “mixed” cities have taken to the streets to assert their identity while living in a self-defined Jewish state.

Fifty-eight Palestinian children have been killed to date in the continuing air raids. “It’s absolutely horrific,” Lee said.

Speaking to Al Jazeera, Boycott Divestment and Sanctions Movement founder Omar Barghouti said the world has to go beyond the UN Security Council and take alternative action in support of Palestinians in the UN General Assembly and the International Criminal Court, but also within states.
“This ongoing Nakba has got to stop, but it will not stop now at the Security Council because it’s hijacked,” Barghouti said. In the Nakba, or “catastrophe”, nearly 800,000 Palestinians were forcibly expelled from their homes to make way for the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948.
“We need to move at the other levels across the world including the UN General Assembly, including the ICC, the International Criminal Court, but also every state can do a lot, such as imposing a military embargo in Israel, cutting relations, cutting trade,” he said.

Al Jazeera’s analyst Marwan Bishara said the Israeli and Palestinian delegations were trying to “score points”, rather than “make points” in a UN Security Council meeting on Sunday.
“Certainly, it sounded to me that the Israeli and the Palestinian spokesperson were speaking to their constituency and to their public opinion because clearly no one present at the Security Council meeting was affected by those speeches that were meant more to score points than to make points,” he added.
“I haven’t seen anything from the Chinese or the British to give me a sign that the Israeli and the Palestinian spokespeople were able to influence them at all. In as far as the rest … it is more of the same.”

“An intelligence office for the Palestinian terrorist organisation [was] housed in that building that plots and organises the terror attacks against Israeli civilians,” Netanyahu told CBS News.
“So it is a perfectly legitimate target. I can tell you that we took every precaution to make sure that there were no civilian injuries, in fact, no deaths.”
Meanwhile, Al Jazeera’s reporter from Gaza who had been working from the now-destroyed building for more than 10 years, said he had “never seen anything [suspicious]”.
“I even asked my colleagues if they’ve seen anything suspicious and they all confirmed to me that they have never seen any military aspects or the fighters even coming in and out,” he added.
AP President and CEO Gary Pruitt told Al Jazeera: “I can tell you that we’ve been in that building for about 15 years for our bureau. We certainly had no sense that Hamas was there.”

“Such a disproportionate attack amounts to war crime. In addition, this follows a pattern of collective punishment against the Palestinian people in Gaza.”
He stressed that more than 51 residential buildings were reported to be destroyed since the beginning of the operation, including high-rise buildings.

“Recent statements made by President Biden, White House spokesperson Jen Psaki, and Department of State spokesperson, Ned Price, completely disregard the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from East Jerusalem, the Israeli assault on Al-Aqsa on worshippers during Ramadan, and the ongoing siege of Gaza that has already claimed the lives of hundreds,” the advocacy group said.
“In a show of solidarity with our Palestinian brothers and sisters in Palestine, the United States, and around the world, a coalition of Muslims nationwide is urging our Muslim community to boycott the White House event and join the ‘Eid with Palestine: A Protest of the White House Eid event.”
Earlier, the Council on American-Islamic Relations also said it would boycott the White House’s Eid celebration.

Al Jazeera’s John Hendren, reporting from Washington, DC, said there was an “unusually large show of support” for the Palestinian cause in the United States on Saturday.
“There were demonstrations in New York, Chicago, Colorado, and in Washington, DC. These were what we thought were an unusually large pro-Palestinian crowd of several thousand people,” he said.
“They wanted the US government to exert more pressure on Israel, to end this conflict. There was a real sense of dissatisfaction that the Biden administration’s policies are really not significantly different than the policies of the Trump administration or any other US administration over the past several years.”
