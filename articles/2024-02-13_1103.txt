How is satire being used to highlight Israel’s war on Gaza?

-----

Israel’s war on Gaza is far from a laughing matter, but some comedians are addressing the story head-on in their stand-up shows. It’s not because they think the destruction or deaths of thousands of Palestinians are funny or worthy of ridicule, but because they believe in the power of satire – comedy’s ability to challenge narratives, build bridges, and even help people heal through humour.
