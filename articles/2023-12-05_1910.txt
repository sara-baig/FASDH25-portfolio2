How does Israel compare to failed states?

-----

Israel has been in a state of near-perpetual war for decades, receives billions of dollars a year in aid and weapons, and has consistently broken international law by expanding its occupation and settlements.
Governments and international human rights organisations have called for war crimes investigations into Israel’s military offensive in Gaza.
Yet, for leader Benjamin Netanyahu, it is “the only democracy in the Middle East”, a view often repeated by supporters.
Critics say Israel is a political entity that can only survive with repression, the denial of rights, and violence.
So is Israel a normal state? Could it be defined as a fragile state? Or does it have the characteristics of a failed state?
