UN’s Navi Pillay: Israel has ‘no intention of ending occupation’

-----

Navi Pillay chairs the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Israel.
Weeks before Hamas carried out its October 7 surprise offensive in southern Israel, and Israel launched a major military operation in Gaza, Pillay released a report (PDF).
It says: “The commission finds the increasingly militarised law enforcement operations of Israel and repeated attacks by Israel on Gaza are aimed at maintaining its unlawful 56-year occupation.”
With the latest escalation now in its third week, Navi Pillay talks to Al Jazeera.
