-----


Social media have been one of the few available ways for Palestinians to tell their stories under the Israeli occupation and blockade. But censorship and account suspensions threaten that outlet. As the war on Gaza escalates, social media companies have tightened their grip further. This is mixed with the rapid spread of disinformation and conflicting narratives like those about the deadly blast at the al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza. So how far is disinformation and censorship steering the conflict?
