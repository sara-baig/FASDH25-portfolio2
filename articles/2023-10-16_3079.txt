Have Israel and Hamas breached the laws of war in Gaza?

-----

Israel’s devastating air strikes and blockade of Gaza after the surprise attack by Hamas on October 7 have led to both sides being accused of violating international humanitarian law.
A United Nations commission says it is collecting evidence of war crimes.
Israel says it’s observing international law.
Bodies such as the International Criminal Court can launch an investigation to determine whether casualties in Palestine and Israel are a violation.
But Israel does not recognise the jurisdiction of the ICC.
So who will hold those responsible to account?
