How will Hamas react to the killing of one of its top leaders?

-----

The assassination of Hamas’s deputy chief, Saleh al-Arouri, is being seen as a major blow against the group’s leadership.
The top commander was killed in Lebanon’s capital Beirut in a drone strike on Tuesday, raising the risk of fighting in the Israel-Gaza war escalating well beyond the Gaza Strip.
It could also signal a new approach to the war by Israel, even though Tel Aviv has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement in the strike.
Nearly three months into the war, al-Arouri’s killing will likely intensify hostilities between Israel and Hamas.
So, will they expand beyond existing conflict zones?
