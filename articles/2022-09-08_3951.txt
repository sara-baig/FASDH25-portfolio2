Ramallah, Occupied West Bank – Israeli forces have killed a Palestinian youth near the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah.
The Palestinian Ministry of Health identified him as 17-year-old Haytham Hani Mubarak.
He was shot dead just after midnight on Thursday near the Israeli military DCO checkpoint at the northern entrance to Ramallah in the central West Bank.
The official news agency for the Palestinian Authority, Wafa, said the Israeli army had “reinforced their military presence” at the checkpoint and were stopping vehicles and checking residency cards.
The Israeli army said in a statement “a suspect attacked” an Israeli “soldier with a hammer” before they killed him.
“The soldier was wounded in the face and received medical treatment on the spot,” the statement said.
The Palestinian man is the latest to have been killed by the Israeli army in the West Bank, with Israel conducting near daily raids on Palestinian towns and cities.
As per the Palestinian Ministry of Health, Israeli forces have killed more than 140 Palestinians in the 1967-occupied territories so far in 2022, including 49 people killed during Israel’s recent three-day offensive on the Gaza Strip.
Nineteen people have also been killed in attacks carried out by Palestinians in Israel and the West Bank in 2022.
