Can Biden pressure Israel for a ceasefire in Gaza?

-----

United States President Joe Biden is facing his biggest international crisis yet.
Israel’s war on Gaza is showing no signs of stopping.
Hospitals, schools, refugee camps – nowhere is safe for Palestinians, with the war now in its sixth week.

But he seems to be struggling to assert any influence on Israel.
Will the Biden administration yield to growing global pressure and help bring about a ceasefire in Gaza?
