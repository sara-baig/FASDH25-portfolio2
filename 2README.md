# Mini Project 2: Geographical Visualization of Gaza Placenames after War from January 2024 News Articles
This project withdraws and envisions geographic references from January 2024 news articles about Gaza. We used two different techniques: regular expressions with a gazetteer and Named Entity Recognition (NER) to compare place recognition.

## Folder Structure
- 'articles': Raw news articles from January 2024 in text format
- 'gazetteers': Contains TSV files
- 'Scripts': Scripts for regex+gazetteer extraction, and for NER using Stanza
- '2README.md': Project documentation
- 'ChatGPT Convos': Documentation of ChatGPT conversations

## Project Overflow
### Zehrish: Use gazetteer and regex to extract places in Gaza from the corpus
### Sara: Use stanza to extract all place names from (part of) the corpus
### Dilawaiz: Create a gazetteer for the NER places
### Zehrish: Map the regex-extracted placenames
### Sara and Dilawaiz: Map the NER-extracted placenames
### Sara, Dilawaiz and Zehrish: ChatGPT documentation
### Sara: README.md
### Sara, Dilawaiz and Zehrish: Finalize the portfolio folder
### Sara, Dilawaiz and Zehrish: Upload to Moodle
